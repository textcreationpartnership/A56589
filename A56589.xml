            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S Advertiſement TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>A Great Part of the Devotions mentioned in this Book, is taken out of the <hi>Breviary,</hi> and other <hi>Offices</hi> now in uſe in the <hi>Roman Church;</hi> the reſt chiefly out of thoſe <hi>Publick Offices</hi> that were uſed in the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> before the <hi>Reformation;</hi> ſuch as the <hi>Breviary</hi> and <hi>Hours</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> and other Books heretofore in great reputation.</p>
            <p>If any one ſhall object againſt the frequent citation of thoſe old Books; My Anſwer is this: No reaſonable man can think it ſtrange, that they ſhould be charged with the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of thoſe Devotions which they have laid aſide: for ſince they were formerly allowed, and recommended and enjoyned, their Church muſt be always accountable for them, or elſe confeſs that ſhe was once miſtaken. If ſhe hath at any time taught her Children to invocate for Saints <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick names,</hi> ſuch as S. <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> and the 7 <hi>Sleepers;</hi> or to inſert in their Prayers <hi>Ridiculous Tales,</hi> ſuch as S. <hi>George</hi>'s killing the Dragon, &amp;c. Theſe either errours or wilful for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
<pb facs="tcp:52080:4"/>
can never conſiſt with her <hi>pretended Infallibility</hi> in Canonizing of Saints, and directing as well the <hi>Worſhip</hi> as the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſtians. But they underſtand too well the conſequence of acknowledging miſtakes, ever to be guilty of ſo much ingenuity: and therefore though they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved many of thoſe <hi>ſcandalous Legends</hi> out of the <hi>common Offices,</hi> it is without diſclaiming them, and with the pretence of other reaſons, ſuch as may ſave the reputation both of the <hi>Legends</hi> and of the <hi>Church</hi> that received them for <hi>true Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.</hi> Thus <hi>Carthagena</hi> informs us, <q>That the Office of S. <hi>Roch</hi> and S. <hi>Anne</hi> (and he might have ſaid the ſame of the reſt) was not left out of the <hi>Roman of Office,</hi>

                  </note> becauſe it contained any untruth in it, but that all things might be reduced to the ancient order.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt of thoſe Saints whoſe <hi>Hiſtories</hi> are omitted in the <hi>Breviary</hi> reformed by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. have proper offices for them, appointed to be uſed in ſome particular Churches. The Allowance is particularly remarkable which this Pope gave to the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> of whoſe <hi>chief Saints</hi> little is ſaid in the <hi>common Breviary,</hi> but very many of their old Leſſons are ſtill retained in the <hi>Proper Offices</hi> of that <hi>Order.</hi> There is no mention made of S. <hi>Crispin</hi> and <hi>Crispinian</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Breviaries;</hi> in that of <hi>Sarum</hi> they have three ſhort Leſſons, <hi>Octob.</hi> 25. But in the <hi>proper Offices</hi> of the Church of <hi>Lisbon</hi> (Printed there 1625) we have three long Leſſons concerning them; wherein they relate, that they were of <hi>Noble Parentage,</hi> that in the Perſecution of <hi>Diocletian,</hi> they ſet up the Trade of Shoo making, in which they were ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily aſſiſted by God, that they exceeded all the Practitioners of the <hi>Gentle Craft,</hi> and mended poor peoples Shooes for nothing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> S. <hi>Gabriel</hi> the Archangel, is alſo left out; but he hath a very ſolemn Office performed by the <hi>Order of the H. Trinity for the Redemption of Captives,</hi> on <hi>March</hi> 18. with ſeveral <hi>Hymns</hi> and Nine <hi>Leſſons:</hi> Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb facs="tcp:52080:4"/>
of the ſame kind are to be found in the <hi>proper Feaſts</hi> of all the ſeveral Orders. It's plain too by the practice of the Vulgar, what judgment they are taught to make of the omiſſion of ſome Names and Hiſtories that were uſed before in their <hi>publick Devotions:</hi> The Saints are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and their number increaſes every day; the old ones have had a fair time to receive the honour and veneration of the People, and may perhaps think it reaſonable to reſign their places to others; any thing will more eaſily be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, than that the Hiſtories were omitted becauſe they are Fabulous. S. <hi>Roch</hi> is left out of the <hi>Kalendar</hi> in the <hi>preſent Breviaries</hi> and <hi>Miſſals,</hi> who had a place there before: but he is ſtill prayed to; Altars and Churches are dedicated in honour of him; his Images and Pictures ſet up; and when a Plague was at <hi>Arles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> a <hi>Fraternity</hi> was erected to his honour,<note place="margin">Martyrol. Franciſc. ad Aug. <hi>16.</hi> p. <hi>350.</hi>
               </note> 40 Days of Indulgence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that Sodality confirmed with many Indulgences by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. <hi>an.</hi> 1629; a fair Church was built, and a ſilver and gilt Statue of S. <hi>Roch</hi> given by the <hi>Fraternity;</hi> and a form of Prayer in time of the <hi>Plague,</hi> relating to his help, remains in the <hi>French Office</hi> of the <hi>Bl. Virgin,</hi> Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> 1615, which I ſhall after mention. So it is too in the caſe of S. <hi>Margaret:</hi> Her <hi>old Legend,</hi> how ſhe was put in Priſon by the Heathen Tyrant <hi>Olybrius,</hi> how the <hi>Devil</hi> in the ſhape of a <hi>Dragon</hi> ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all expunged; and though ſhe has a place ſtill in the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> yet there is neither <hi>Proper Leſſon</hi> nor <hi>Proper Prayer</hi> remains for her: and yet ſtill it is made uſe of, it is read to <hi>Women in Labour</hi> (that burſting of the belly of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> out of which ſhe came forth, being interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſuppoſe, for a kind of Child-birth) and Women with Child are girded with her <hi>Girdle,</hi> kept in S. <hi>Germans Abbey</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the <hi>Friers</hi> perform that charitable office for them. Since therefore theſe old and Fabulous Devotions have the <hi>countenance</hi> of <hi>common practice,</hi> and the <hi>favourable
<pb facs="tcp:52080:5"/>
connivance</hi> at leaſt of <hi>their Church,</hi> there can be no reaſon to blame me for giving an account of them.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when the many <hi>falſe Reliques,</hi> which give life to the ſuperſtition of the Vulgar, are every where publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expoſed and venerated, thoſe of the moſt <hi>Romantick Saints</hi> not excepted: If they intended that their Hiſtories ſhould be no longer believed, when they left out their old Leſſons; why did they not at the ſame time prohibit any farther ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their pretended remains? Can <hi>theſe</hi> be juſtified by any Tradition, that will not juſtifie <hi>all the reſt</hi> that is ſaid of <hi>them?</hi> Will it be enough, when I ſet down the Romance of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula,</hi> and the 11000 <hi>Virgins</hi> out of <hi>the old Breviaries,</hi> to tell me, that there is not a word of their ſtory remains in the <hi>New;</hi> when at <hi>Colen</hi> all paſſes as current as ever, and a thouſand of their Reliques are there and at other places ſtill produced? Can this Church be thought to intend, that men, if they pleaſe, may disbelieve the <hi>Acts</hi> of S. <hi>George,</hi> and yet at the ſame time countenance the ſhowing of his <hi>Arme?</hi> If they really deſign the reformation of abuſes, why do they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin it where the cheat is moſt notorious, and where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill hear and read more Fables, than in all the Leſſons of the <hi>old Breviary</hi> put together? I do not hear that this Trading with Reliques is as yet ſet up publickly by them in <hi>England;</hi> but it will, no doubt, be uſed in due time, if they ſucceed in their hopes: it cannot be amiſs therefore to let <hi>our People</hi> underſtand the way of this Traffick, and what <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king commodities</hi> they expoſe in <hi>other places:</hi> and becauſe the following Book will afford the Reader many rarities of the Saints Reliques; I will therefore here only give him one <hi>ſmall Collection,</hi> with their Speeches to the People at the ſhowing of them, as I find them in a <hi>Print</hi> of theirs of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion at <hi>Aquiſgranum</hi> or <hi>Aken,</hi> 1650.

                     <p>IT may ſeem a little ſtrange, that the words of the 45 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> which are plainly Prophetical of our Saviour, ſhould be here applyed to this Virgin: but I doubt it is worſe ſtill, and I wiſh they did not profanely pick out theſe words of <hi>Grace on thy Lips</hi> (though they have been uſed alſo to other Saints) and apply them to her with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reaſon, in alluſion to what went before, concerning the graceful beard that grew there; for I obſerve they are very good at ſuch alluſions:<note place="margin">Horae. ſec. uſ.

The reaſon of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52080:16"/>
this addition is plain, becauſe the Goſpel ſayes preſently, <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c.</hi> and they thought it not fit, that Chriſt ſhould ſay theſe words to any but to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> to whom the Keys of the Kingdom or Heaven were committed. Now in the preſent Books it is altered thus. <hi>In illo tempore dixit Jeſus diſcipulis ſuis,</hi> which is an addition to the Text ſtill, for there are no ſuch words there, though more tolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is true, that Chriſt did ſpeak them to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                        <p>And as they have endeavoured to abuſe the Text, ſo they have alſo made lewd comments in ſeveral places upon it. Of which I'le give the Reader a few remarkable Inſtances, as I find them in a Book called the <hi>Feſtivale</hi> (or Homilies upon the Feſtivals before the Reformation:) We read in the Goſpel that the Bl. Virgin was aſtoniſhed when the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought his happy Meſſage to her; now that Book gives this reaſon for it. <q>There was in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a Man that coude moch Witchcraft, and ſo with help of <hi>Fiendes,</hi> he made himſelf like an Angel, and came to divers Maydens, and ſaid he was ſent from God to them on his Meſſage, and ſo often times lay with them, and did them great villany: Then when our Lady heard tell of that Man, ſhe was addread leſt it had been he, for ſhe had ſpoke with none Angel before, <hi>fol.</hi> 93.</q>

                     <p>THis piece of Devotion is ſo great an inſtance of the folly and groſs ſuperſtition of this Church, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make ſome conſiderable Remarques upon it, before I go farther: and eſpecially becauſe this tale of the 3 Kings of <hi>Colen,</hi> is again revived by Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> in his late Church-Hiſtory, who I ſee is reſolved (ſuch is his diſcretion) to play all the loſt Games of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and would fain give veneration to a ſtory, which for its ridiculouſneſs (and without any other deſign) has been ſet to a Tune in the Catch-Book, after it had been blotted out of the Devotions of the Church.</p>
                     <p>It cannot but ſeem very ſtrange to all but thoſe who are for <hi>Devotion</hi> without <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> that any ſhould in their addreſſes to Almighty God, preſume to tell him their idle and uncertain ſtories; eſpecially when they have his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection (who ſure beſt knows what is pleaſing to himſelf) what name they are to uſe, and to whom they are to go in all their prayers, that they may ſpeed in Heaven. We have oft heard of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> in the Scripture, as a prevailing <hi>Advocate</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> but never a word there of the <hi>Mother of God,</hi> as deſtined to ſuch an Office; or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any there, that ever <hi>came to God</hi> by <hi>her,</hi> or by any
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52080:18"/>
other <hi>departed Saint.</hi> A man might well ſuſpect, that theſe men who thus apply themſelves to them, imagined that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hands were too full of Petitions, or that his heart was not ſo tender as theirs; (which I ſhall after ſhow, is indeed their plain ſence concerning the Bl. <hi>Virgin,</hi>) or that ſome Courtiers in Heaven had lately ſtept into greater honour and favour with God than he. But how I pray come theſe 3 Kings of <hi>Colen</hi> to be in ſo much vogue for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion? The Scripture, I am ſure, neither tells us, that the Men who came from the Eaſt to viſit our Saviour, and to offer gifts to Him, were either Kings, or that their number was onely three (their three offerings do not prove it, for each one might offer all three) or that their names were <hi>Jaſpar, Melchior</hi> and <hi>Balthaſar;</hi> and yet all this muſt be put (as if it were unqueſtionable) into a Prayer. But, it may be they will ſay that Tradition will ſupply all theſe defects. If it were ſuch a Tradition as has delivered the Bible to us, and the names of the ſeveral Writers of that Holy Book, we might and would accept it; that is, if it were ancient enough, and agreed with it ſelf. But the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> (not to mention others) has ſaid enough in his ſecond Exercitation, number the 10th. againſt <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to ſhow the folly of this pretence.

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52080:19"/>I think if I had their perſwaſions, that the Saints are mightily pleaſed with the addreſſes that are made to them, and reflected withall upon the ſlender aſſurance that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they were but three in number, I ſhould be afraid, leſt there ſhould happen to be a fourth, and he as deſerving a King as any of the other; and that every time I invoked the three, I ſhould be in danger of diſobliging him, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fellows venerated and courted perpetually, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without regard, and having nothing to do. But what if they have gueſſed right at their number, and have been out in their names? Are they ſure that the Saints will not take it ill to be miſcall'd? And what if they ſhould not know, whether you have any thing for them to do, till they hear their own true names? What will this prayer then do good to <hi>Jaſpar, Melchior</hi> and <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> when another tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſays their names were, <hi>Apellius, Amerus</hi> and <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> a third, that they were, <hi>Magalath, Galgalath</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racin;</hi> and a fourth calls them, <hi>Ator, Sator</hi> and <hi>Peratoras?</hi> which laſt I ſhould chuſe (in this uncertainty) to call them by, as having the more Kingly ſound, if it had not been for a ſcurvy ſtory <hi>Caſaubon</hi> mentions out of an old <hi>Greek</hi> book, that theſe three, together with <hi>Miſael, Achael, Cyriacus</hi> and <hi>Stephanus</hi> (the names of the 4. Shepherds that came to viſit our Lord in <hi>Bethlehem</hi>) had been uſed (and he tells how) for a charm to cure the biting of Serpents and other venemous Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>But it may be I needed not have offered all this about their names, ſince neither Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> nor <hi>Baronius</hi> (who has ſo large a diſcourſe concerning them) have undertaken to juſtify this prayer in that reſpect, or ſo much as to mention how they were called. Let us come therefore to the main matter, wherein Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> is to be conſidered, and that is concerning their Reliques to be ſeen at <hi>Colen,</hi> which is the reaſon they are called the 3 Kings of <hi>Colen;</hi> for I hope the Laity of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, though they are very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, yet do not imagine, that theſe three ever raigned in that place together, like the 2 Kings of <hi>Brentford.</hi>

very time when <hi>Milan</hi> was taken by <hi>Frederick,</hi> and who mentions, that theſe Bodies of the <hi>Magi</hi> were found in an old deſtroyed Monaſtery, yet adds, <hi>That this Treaſure was not known to the Monks and Clergy that miniſtred there, but was found when the Church was overturned to the foundation, and revealed by manifeſt tokens, to whom they did belong</hi> (but what thoſe tokens were he ſays not a word of) and a little after,— <hi>Nor was it known by what Perſons their holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques were brought and laid there;</hi> (it ſeems there was not a word ſaid about <hi>Helena</hi> at this time.) Beſides, it is ſcarce imaginable, if this ſtory were true, that not one word of it ſhould be mentioned either by <hi>Euſebius</hi> or <hi>Socrates,</hi> and eſpecially not by his beloved <hi>Baronius,</hi> who with ſo much care has collected out of all Authors the progreſs of <hi>Helena</hi> into the Eaſt, to the holy Land; who certainly was led to it in her extream Age of above Fourſcore, out of Devotion to the Sepulchre, and to viſit the places, that were ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the actions and ſufferings of our Lord; and when ſhe had found what ſhe went in Queſt of, he tells us of no journey forward, or circuit ſhe made into the Eaſt, but there, for ought we can learn, her ſteps reſted till her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. And indeed, by what thoſe Authors relate of her, we may eaſily conceive, how ſhe might ſpend a <hi>Twelve-moneth</hi> (if ſhe had ſo long a time both for her progreſs and return) without going farther. For we hear, when ſhe came to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of her curious ſearch after the Croſs, for the finding of which, ſhe was fain to dig ſome while, and of her building two Churches, one at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and another at Mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> And as her great Age muſt needs make it improbable, that ſhe ſhould take much pleaſure in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther journeying, when this great curioſity was ſatisfied: ſo the <hi>little time ſhe lived after,</hi> makes it ſtill more: for <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius</hi> makes it out,<note place="margin">Valeſ not. in Euſeb. de vit.

               <p>But I have not yet done with Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> but muſt add a few words more to tell him, that he quite miſtook his Cue, in ſtuffing and ſwelling his Hiſtory to ſuch a great bulk, by ſuch a prodigious number of Legends, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of the Saints and Miracles about them: that his Faith is a great deal too big (for ſo charitable I'le be, though ſome I doubt will imagine him to have none at all) and his Diſcretion apparently too little for the inquiſitiveneſs and Learning of the Age he lives in. That in this wild way of promoting his Faction, he has done infinite diſſervice to our common Chriſtianity, and that in an Age, wherein too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, God knows, are inclined to Infidelity, by prejudicing them againſt the belief of the undoubted Miracles, by which our Chriſtianity is proved, when they ſee ſuch an heap of wonders produced, to countenance apparent foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries and ſuperſtitions, but little differing from that of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52080:21"/>
                  <hi>Heathens,</hi> and things contrary to the ſenſe of all ſober Man-kind. If he had lived in the 9, or 10 Century (as his Talent ſeems to be fitted for ſuch a credulous Age) I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe that he would not onely have been famed for a <hi>Writer</hi> of others Miracles, but ſome <hi>Monk</hi> or other, would have made him a <hi>worker</hi> of them too.

that S. <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> brought with him into <hi>Brittany</hi> two Silver Veſſels, filled with the Blood of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which precious Veſſels, by his order, were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him in his Tomb: and he gives two excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, why he would have them thus buried with him. 1. Becauſe, if they ſhould have been conſigned to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons in thoſe times, before Chriſtianity was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Iſland, either a loſing and profanation of them could ſcarce have been avoided:</q> 
                  <hi>(by the ſame reaſon we ſhould never more have heard of the Spear; and why could not a Miracle, ſuch as is ſhow'd perpetually in preſerving and increaſing the Wood of the Croſs, have preſerved them?</hi>) <q>Whereas a certainty that they were reſerved in that place, would be an occaſion to ſtir up the Devotion of preſent and ſucceeding Chriſtians to frequent it, and reap benefit by the vertue of them. 2. Again, Saint <hi>Joſeph</hi> had no doubt the ſame deſign herein, that the Emperour <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> expreſt, who made (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques he had collected of the Apoſtles, be laid up in his Tomb, to the end that being dead, he might be partaker of the Prayers, which there in honour of the Apoſtles ſhould be offered to God:</q> [both which reaſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by himſelf in the foregoing Chapter, where he tells us, that the particular place where S. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was buried is unknown, and that though one <hi>John Blome,</hi> (thinking he had a Revelation) obtained leave from the King to ſearch for it, yet his labour was in vain, and that his Reliques could never be diſcovered; inſomuch as ſome anciently doubted, whether he was indeed buried at <hi>Glaſtonbury.</hi>] But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever highly he may ſeem to eſtimate the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> while it is thus preſerved in Glaſſes and Silver Veſſels; yet I doubt he forgot one thing, which argues it, in my Opinion, to be more ſacred, and too precious to be depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any where on Earth; and that is, (what the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> inſiſts on) that this Blood was to be preſented in the moſt holy place,<note place="margin">

But Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> calls us to harder tasks of believing ſtill in ſome other inſtances he gives about the Saints bodies.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> The one is concerning St. <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Martyrology. Where it is ſaid, <q>That he was wonderfully buried in <hi>three</hi> places, ſeeing <hi>three</hi> Towns, <hi>Aldham, Tinningham,</hi> and <hi>Preston,</hi> contended for his body.</q> The meaning of which is, that his whole body unremoved was buried in <hi>three</hi> places, elſe it was no wonder at all. This Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> believes, and ſo do I, only we differ in this ſmall circumſtance, that I believe it to be a ſtupid and notorious lye. But I ſeem plainly to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that he did not intend that we Proteſtants ſhould much trouble our ſelves about it; for he knew well enough, that this was too hard a morſel for us to ſwallow down, upon the meer credit of a Martyrology: but oh this is a ſweet ſtory for his Catholicks, who are reſolved to believe in ſpight of all their reaſon, that the whole Body of <hi>Christ</hi> may be at the ſame time in a thouſand places; and let them take the comfort of it, I ſhall not envy them. Another is ſomewhat to the ſame purpoſe, concerning S. <hi>Theliau:</hi> 
                  <q>After he was dead,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> the Inhabitants of <hi>three</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places contended earneſtly which of them ſhould enjoy his body: thoſe of <hi>Pennalum,</hi> where his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had been buried; thoſe of <hi>Lanteliovaur,</hi> where he dyed; and thoſe of <hi>Landaff,</hi> among whom he had been Biſhop. When therefore no agreement could be made amongſt them, there appeared preſently <hi>three</hi> Bodies ſo like to one another, that <hi>three</hi> eggs could not more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſemble. So each of theſe People took one of them, and by that means the controverſy ended. <hi>But then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> That by frequent miracles at his Tomb it appeared, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Landaff</hi> poſſeſſed the true Body.</q>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52080:27"/>
This ſtory neither need create us but little trouble, ſince, as good luck will have it, it confutes it ſelf. For can any one imagine, that when three Towns are with equal zeal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion contending for the poſſeſſion of ſo great a Treaſure as his Body was, that only one of them ſhould glory in the prize? or that the ſame miracle which gave it them, ſhould give them occaſion to laugh at the other two, who were fobb'd and cheated with an aery Image, and made to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a <hi>cloud</hi> inſtead of <hi>Juno?</hi> I can allow eaſily that God might <hi>deny</hi> 20 Towns, who ſhould have put in for it, but I cannot believe that he would thus <hi>deceive</hi> one: This was a trick fit for none but the Devil to play, who delights in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage and abuſing of Man-kind: but rather than thus to think of God, I'le ſooner be perſwaded that a tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Father, when <hi>three</hi> of his hungry Children cry to him for Bread, will fill the Belly of one of them, and ſtill the complaints of the other two, only with a painted Baby or a Rattle. And now me thinks I begin to be weary of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe follies, and it's well if I have not made the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do ſome penance too; ſince therefore I hope I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſecured him, from giving too haſty a credit to Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s Legends, I dare now truſt him with ſuch idle tattle, as this that follows. (Only premiſing, that if there were 20 more ſuch miracles told us, though we ſhould hear of the finding Children unhurt on the tops of Trees in Eagles neſts, as in the caſe of <hi>Nesting, (lib.</hi> 32. <hi>c.</hi> 19.) if they have the ſeal of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi>'s age, or the next upon them, that is, refer to 900, or a 1000 Years after <hi>Christ,</hi> the Reader may give them a paſs in courſe, and need not examine them far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ſtop them.)</p>

               <p>I am willing to fancy alſo, that when the angry fit is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and he will calmly hear me ſpeak for my ſelf, I ſhall be able, if not to make him my Friend, yet at leaſt make him have a better opinion of me: In order to which, I firſt of all aſſure him, that I have a mighty veneration for true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, true Saints, and true Hiſtories, and, which may make his pique the leſs againſt me, that I am none of the <hi>Married Clergy.</hi> But then I add farther, that if I am ſpoyl'd as to my faith in his hiſtory, he himſelf has helpt to do it: he is the Perſon who has taught me to be cautious, and to ſuſpend my belief, to conſider the nature of the things, as well as the number or fame of the Writers that aſſert them, before I give credit to them. I'le give him an inſtance of his own, which, as I take it, gives any man liberty to believe as much, or as little as he pleaſes, about the Reliques and Miracles that are recorded in his Book: it is that which I find, <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. concerning the <hi>Staff of Jeſus:</hi> which I will ſet

               <p>
                  <q>St. <hi>Patrick</hi> by Divine Revelation, paſſed over to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſolitary <hi>Hermit,</hi> living in an Iſland of the <hi>Tyrrhen Sea,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Juſtus;</hi> which he made good by his actions, being a Man of a Holy Life, great Fame and much Merit. After devout ſalutations and good diſcourſe, the ſame man of God gave to S. <hi>Patrick</hi> a Staff, which he ſeriouſly affirmed, had been beſtowed on him immediatly by the hand of our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> himſelf, who had appear'd to him. Now there was in the ſame Iſland at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, other men alſo who lived ſolitary lives, of which ſome ſeem'd very freſh and youthful, and others were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit old men. S. <hi>Patrick,</hi> after ſome converſation with them, was informed, that thoſe very old men, were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to thoſe who appeared ſo youthful. At which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſtoniſht, and inquiring the occaſion of ſo great a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, they thus acquainted him, ſaying; We from our Child-hood by Divine grace, have been much addicted to works of mercy, ſo that our Doors were always open to all Travellers which demanded Meat or Lodging. On a certain Night it happened, that a ſtranger having a <hi>Staff</hi> in his hand, was entertained by us, whom we uſed with all the courteſie we could. On the Morning after he gave us his Benediction, and ſaid, I am <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers you have oft hitherto miniſtred to, and this Night entertained me in my own Perſon. After this he gave the Staff which he had in his hand, to a Man of God, our Father both ſpiritually and carnally; commanding him to keep it, till in ſucceeding times, a certain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger named <hi>Patrick</hi> ſhould come to viſit him, and to him he ſhould give it: Having ſaid this, he preſently aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven; and from that day we have remained in the ſame ſtate of youthful comelineſs and vigour to this hour; whereas our Children, who then were little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, are now as you ſee become decrepit old men.</q> 
                  <hi>Thus far the story.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52080:29"/>Now I deſire any man that has read Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s Church-Hiſtory, to tell me, whether he look upon this as the moſt ſtrange and improbable ſtory in his Book; and whether there be not 40 others, as unlikely to be true? But now that which amazes me, is, that in all the prodigious things Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> has related, and thoſe few of them I have ſet down before; I never to my remembrance found his faith at a ſtand, but only here. This he leaves uncharitably to ſhift for it ſelf, and take its chance; <hi>Whatſoever fortune ſo stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious a story may find in the mind of the Reader,</hi> (they are his words) and before he tells it out of <hi>Joceline,</hi> he ſays thus, <hi>Without interpoſing my credit for the truth of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I thank Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> with all my heart; this was the paſſage I waited for a great while, but could not meet with it before; I thought I ſhould have heard ſomething like it, when he told us of the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> kept in Silver Veſſels and Cryſtal Glaſſes; but that was too near the beginning of his Book, and every Catholick Reader would have cry'd ſhame on the Jadiſhneſs of Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> faith, if at the firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from eaſie trot into full ſpeed, it ſhould have lagg'd or drawn a lame Leg after it: But here it does you ſee; he dare not atteſt the truth of this. Why, what's the matter? Is not <hi>Joceline</hi> a man fit to be relyed upon? he has never told, that I know, any ſtories in favour of Hereticks; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am ſure this is none of them: and ſuppoſe it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon his ſingle teſtimony, yet that's no news at all for Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> to aſſert a miracle upon the credit of one witneſs. <hi>Capgrave,</hi> I am ſure, has many a time been truſted, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as hard to be believed as this. But the caſe is not ſo here; We have Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> both of them ſpeaking home to the point, as to this <hi>Staff of Jeſus,</hi> and if there were need of farther witneſſes, the whole <hi>Iriſh Nation</hi> is ready to depoſe for it; ſo that (as <hi>Cambrenſis</hi> tells us) in their Opinion, it was with this very Staff, that S. <hi>Patrick</hi> caſt out of the Iſland all venemous beaſts.

               <p>And now I think it is high time to remember my promiſe, and give the Reader as ſhort an account as I can of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Controverſie two Ages ago, concerning the <hi>Ring</hi> with which the <hi>Bl.

                  <note place="margin">The famous Controverſie about the Sponſal Ring of the Bl. Virgin.</note> which ſtory I hope will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what refreſh him; and ſhow him into what folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs People will run, when their Religion degenerates into ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>The ſtory was firſt written by <hi>Joh. Baptiſta Laurus</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Protonotary of <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and one of the Bed-chamber to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII. His Book was Printed at <hi>Rome, An.</hi> 1622. (and afterwards put by <hi>Bzovius</hi> into his <hi>Annal. Eccleſiaſtic. ad an.</hi> 1480.) I ſhall give you the ſubſtance of it, leaving you to conſult him in his large excurſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laurus</hi> begins his ſtory with this ſuppoſition; that in contracting of marriages, Rings were in uſe, not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> but alſo among the ancient <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as a teſtimony of Faith and Conjugal affection: (which becauſe it is the foundation of all that follows, we'l conſider the truth of it in the Concluſion) He then adds, that thoſe Ancient Rings of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> were not of <hi>Gold</hi> (that he knew would not ſo well agree to the meanneſs of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s condition) but of baſer mettals, as <hi>Iron;</hi> or were made of an <hi>Onyx-ſtone,</hi> to ſhew the frugality and parſimony of the ancient manner of living. And he ſays, that this of the B. Virgin, muſt not be thought like thoſe Rings, we
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52080:31"/>
read that Chriſt often uſed in myſtical marriages with holy Virgins, as S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> S. <hi>Catharine</hi> of <hi>Sena,</hi> &amp;c. which were Rings in <hi>appearance:</hi> nor of the ſame kind with that, wherewith S. <hi>Joachim</hi> was married to S. <hi>Anne</hi> the Mother of the Bl. Virgin, and is kept at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Nuns of S. <hi>Anne, (another precious treaſure)</hi> for that is a rude Silver one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is the <hi>true</hi> Ring with which the Bl. Virgin was eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> made of an ord'nary <hi>Onyx,</hi> or <hi>Amethyst</hi> (for it is ſomewhat doubtful, ſays he, which it is) which being very old, ſeems to have ſomething obſcurely ingraven on it, where ſome fancy they diſcern flowers, repreſenting the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of old <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Rod: (which is an old Fable, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the old <hi>Roman</hi> Breviary on S. <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Day, <hi>March</hi> 19. that to know to whom the Bl. Virgin was to be eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the High-Prieſt commanded, that all that were unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſhould appear at the Temple, and bring dry Rods in their hands, which <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo did; but in the preſence of all, his Rod had green Leaves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon it, and ſome add (which this Author mentions) that a Dove deſcending from Heaven, ſat upon the top of his Rod.</p>
               <p>Theſe, you'l ſay, are good preparations, and now follows the Hiſtory of this wonderful Ring. Of which there is not one word ſaid, till the days of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the V. and of the Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> the III. who both began their Raign together, <hi>an.</hi> 996. So that we are fallen again into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Age, and I'le warrant you the ſtory will work right which commences there; eſpecially after that the Ring had lien dormant a 1000 Years before.</p>
               <p>At this time then, <hi>Judith</hi> the Wife of one <hi>Hugo</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Etruria,</hi> being a great Lover of Jewels, imployed one <hi>Ranerius</hi> a Jeweller of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> and a skilful Lapidary, and to whom ſhe gave good ſtore of Money, to go to <hi>Rome</hi> to make a purchaſe for her. Here it was, by the favour of Heaven, that <hi>Ranerius</hi> meets with a Jeweller come from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whom (you ſhall hear preſently how) he obtained this Ring: and (as the Author adds) it was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52080:31"/>
not fitting, that any where elſe, ſave at <hi>Rome,</hi> (which is the great Market of ſacred Reliques, and already poſſeſſed the Manger where <hi>Christ</hi> was laid) this Sponſal-Ring of his Mother ſhould be brought to light. After then that <hi>Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerus</hi> has furniſht himſelf, and was now ready to depart and take his leave of his Merchant, the Jeweller profeſſing a ſtrange love to him, takes out this Ring and preſents it to <hi>Reinerus,</hi> as a pledge of their future kindneſs: which he looking upon as a thing of little or no value, would have put off the receiving it with a ſlight complement. But the Jeweller bid him not to contemn it, though its aſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke it to be of no great value, for it was the Ring by which the Virgin was eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph:</hi> and ſo made him take it with this charge, that he ſhould carefully ſee, that it did not come into the hands of any wicked perſon. But <hi>Reinerus</hi> not regarding what he ſaid, when he came home, careleſly threw it aſide in a little Cheſt, among other things of ſmall value. [And, to add that before I go on, he had indeed no great reaſon to mind his words much, for if the cunning Merchant, had known it really to have been what he pretended, he would unqueſtionably rather have made a preſent of it to the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, (who would ſure have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded him well for ſuch a treaſure, if he could have made it out, that it belonged to the B. Virgin) than have given it to one who was wholly a ſtranger to him, and whoſe whole purchaſe of Jewels bought of him, could not come near the value of this one Ring; but to proceed.] <hi>Ranerius</hi> at his return to <hi>Cluſium,</hi> gives an account to <hi>Judith,</hi> how he had laid out her Money, but forgot to ſay a word to her of the Ring, and if he had at that time, it might have ſignified little, for ſhe was more addicted to Pride than Religion, being of her Husbands humour, who minded little elſe but his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſports: but he in a Viſion of the B. Virgin to him, at a time when he had been wearied with Hunting, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely chidden; and the effect of it was, that he became a devout Perſon, and built many Religious Houſes, and a very venerable one at <hi>Florence,</hi> in honour of the B. Virgin;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52080:32"/>
his Wife <hi>Judith</hi> alſo became remarkable afterwards for her Piety.</p>
               <p>But the forgetfulneſs of <hi>Ranerius</hi> coſt him very dear; for having only one Son of 10 Years old (and ſo long it was that he had diſregarded the Ring of the Virgin) he fell ſick and dyed, and was carried out to be buried at the Church of S. <hi>Muſthiola</hi> hard by <hi>Cluſium.</hi> As the Herſe went forward, on a ſudden the dead Body of his Son riſes in the Coffin, bids the Bearers ſtand ſtill, and calls to his Father to come to him, to whom he ſpake to this effect. That by the favour of the B. Virgin, he was come to him from Heaven (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after he had delivered his meſſage, he muſt return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) to convince him of his contempt of Religion, for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that moſt holy Jewel be in a common heap, he having never ſhow'd it to any body, no not ſo much as to him: that now he muſt ſend for it, and produce it publickly, that it might be venerated; and that he might not doubt of the truth of what he ſaid, he gave him a ſign, by telling him of his ſecret vows of taking a Pilgrimage to Mount <hi>Garganus,</hi> and to <hi>Siponto,</hi> and of repairing a Church, which he had not performed.</p>
               <p>Immediately the Cheſt is ſent for, and delivered into the Son's hand, who amidſt a number of other ſtones, preſently findes the Ring (though he had never ſeen it before) and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently kiſſed it, and openly ſhow'd it to the company, who were all in readineſs to venerate it; and the Bells, as ſome ſay, of their own accord rung a joyful Peal, as a ſign of publick happineſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">The like story is told us of St. <hi>Pega,</hi> that going from <hi>England</hi> on Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe entred the City, the Bells of every Church rung out, of their own accord, for an Hours ſpace, and told all the City the merit of her ſanctity.

conflux of People to viſit this holy Relique, wherefore bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Gold-Chain to the Ring, they prepared a Coffer to keep it in; but before it was laid up, it wrought ſeveral wonders.

And when one <hi>Pimpinellus,</hi> a Canon of the Lateran Church, tryed with two of his fingers, whether the praeputium was ſoft or hard, by the preſſure of his fingers, he brake it into two parts; upon the doing of which, ſays he, Oh wonderful, what Thunders there were, what Lightnings, how dark the Ayre was over the place, ſo that even all the by-ſtanders were even dead for fear. All which being related to the Pope, they confirmed them for true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; and for the greater fame of the place, <hi>Sixtus V. anno 1584.</hi> grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a plenary indulgence in that Church of <hi>Calcata,</hi> on the day of Christ's Circumciſion, for Ten Years.</note> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and ſo continued to her death. It is ſaid alſo, that one <hi>Contulus,</hi> who was troubled with a <hi>Sciatica,</hi> made an impreſſion of the Ring in wax, and applying it to his Hip, when the pain afflicted him, always found eaſe by it. And the Author ſays, that he, at the intreaty of ſome great Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, cauſed ſome Ivory Rings to be touched with that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred one, and they received ſuch vertue from it, that being put upon the finger of Women that had hard Labour, they

were preſently relieved: The Ring alſo was found benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial for defects in the eyes, and for reconciling the affections of married People that lived at odds, and the freeing ſeveral from the vexation of evil ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Thus this Sponſal Ring of the B. Virgin, remained in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Cluſians</hi> 484 Years.</p>
               <p>After this it came into the hands of the <hi>Peruſians,</hi> an. 1473. in this manner following.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Muſthiola</hi> becoming ruinous, where it had remained, it was brought into an Houſe of the <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> in <hi>Cluſium,</hi> and freely enough ſhown to the People; which a certain <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier, a <hi>German,</hi> obſerving, whoſe name was <hi>Wintherus,</hi> a very crafty Knave, under the ſhew of great devotion, he begs of the Magiſtrates of <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium</hi> to have the office of ſhowing the Ring, who granted his petition. One time, after he had made a Sermon and ſhowed it to the People, ſtooping, as if he intended to put it up in the place provided for it, he ſecretly conveighs it into his ſleeve, and locking the Door, gives the Key boldly to the Magiſtrate, and privily conveighs himſelf away from <hi>Cluſium,</hi> taking the Ring along with him. He had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er croſſed the River, but the Field was fill'd with ſo thick a Miſt and Darkneſs, that he knew not which way to turn himſelf or go: At laſt, his conſcience ſmiting him for what he had done, taking the Ring out of his boſome, he hang'd it by the Chain upon a little bough of a Tree, and falling on the ground, with tears he accuſes himſelf, and expoſtulating his ſad condition to the Ring, if he ſhould return to <hi>Cluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> he prays to the Ring, that it would ſend forth ſuch light, as to diſpell the Miſt, and direct him by it, in the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſhould go: Preſently he took the Ring again, and there came ſo great a light from it, as ſhow'd him the way to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> where he put in among the <hi>Auguſtan Friers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A while after he attempted to go into <hi>Germany,</hi> his own Country, (whither he at firſt deſigned to carry it) but he was hindred in the ſame manner by the darkneſs that again came ſuddenly on him, ſo that he was forced to ſtay: and

this not only infeſted him, but the whole City for 20 Days, till at laſt he unboſom'd himſelf to his Landlord, one <hi>Lucas Jordanus,</hi> and declared to him all the adventure of the Ring; who with great craft and cunning, by repreſenting the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was in from the <hi>Cluſians,</hi> and the benefits he would receive from thoſe of <hi>Peruſia,</hi> he prevailed with him at laſt to beſtow it upon this City; and as ſoon as ever it was ſhowed to the People, all the Miſts and Darkneſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſcattered and diſperſed.

They allowed alſo an Annual Penſion to the Brothers of <hi>Luke Jordan,</hi> who had done them ſuch good ſervice in procuring the Ring: and now their next care was to provide by all poſſible ſecurities, that the Ring ſhould never more be taken out of their poſſeſſion: It was kept therefore under 4 Locks, whoſe Keys were delivered to 4 Fraternities, of the <hi>Dominicans, Franciſcans, Servitae, &amp; Auguſtinians,</hi> and was never to be ſhow'd, but when they were by: it was alſo decreed, that it ſhould not be in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of any Mortal to carry it any whither out of Town, nay it was Baniſhment for any one to propoſe ſo much. They alſo, the better to grace the ſolemnity of ſhowing it, ordered the Fathers to appear in coſtly Habits; Drums, Trumpets, Organs, Bells, and a Muſical Conſort to ſound at that time; and they took a publick Oath of thoſe, to whoſe care it was committed (confirmed by taking the Sacrament in the preſence of the Biſhop, and Magiſtrates, and all the Clergy) to look carefully to it. Three appointed times of the Year, they decreed it ſhould be ſhown, the Fraternities accompanying it from the Palatine Chappel to S. <hi>Laurence</hi> Church; and there in a Pulpit, one of the chief Prelates, ſhould hold it to be ſeen, the ſpace of one Hour, Morning
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52080:34"/>
and Afternoon: After this it was ordered to be ſhown only once a Year; but that Law was abrogated a while after, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the clamorous Petitions of devout People. But now the Controverſie grew hot, between the <hi>Senenſes</hi> (whoſe Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents the <hi>Cluſians</hi> were) and the <hi>Peruſians:</hi> and one while the Pope hears of the Miracles that were done by the Ring, ſince it came to <hi>Peruſia,</hi> and how fit it was, that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould ſtill retain it: Then the Embaſſadors of <hi>Sena</hi> were brought to him, by means of Cardinal <hi>Riarius</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſinus,</hi> to whom they had promiſed 25000 Pieces of Gold, in caſe by their means the <hi>Cluſians</hi> ſhould get the day, <hi>(which I much wonder that it did not determine the buſineſs)</hi> and they repreſent to him, how much the <hi>Peruſians</hi> had been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beholden to them, how ungrateful they had been to them in this affair, and ſacrilegious in detaining that which they had got by theft, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> appoints <hi>Eight</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to hear the matter, and to weigh the Reaſons on both ſides, and in the mean while enjoyns the contending Parties to live in peace, telling them how abſurd a thing it was, that the Ring which was a pledge of Love and Conjugal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſhould now be an occaſion of contention and ſtrife: <hi>(and it was abſurd enough in all conſcience, without this witty Reaſon which the Pope gives.)</hi> The Embaſſadors on both ſides, returned, and were gladly received, the <hi>Peruſians</hi> eſpecially rejoyced, thinking their cauſe was the better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. But the two forenamed Cardinals, being allured with the great promiſes which the <hi>Senenſes</hi> made to them, in caſe they could overthrow the <hi>Peruſians,</hi> went thither to ſollicit their cauſe; where being honourably received, they, in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> began to urge the <hi>Peruſians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Ring, that had, for ſo many Ages, belonged to them of <hi>Cluſium,</hi> and in generoſity, not to ſuffer ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful mark of injuſtice to lye upon them; this they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed at firſt more privately, afterwards openly, and at laſt came ſo far as to threaten them with the ſad effects of War, in caſe they refuſed. But while theſe things were thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted Cardinal <hi>Riarius</hi> dies in the flower of his Age, being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52080:35"/>
but 28 Years old, and the <hi>Peruſians,</hi> being frighted with the Authority of the other, prepare for War, and begin bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fortify themſelves; they ſend Embaſſadors to <hi>Venice, Florence, Millan</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> to intreat their aſſiſtance, and raiſed a Band of men. A few Moneths after, the <hi>Peruſians</hi> began ſome skirmiſhes againſt the <hi>Cluſians,</hi> who preyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their flocks, and laid hands on the Countrey-men they met, and put them in hold; neither did the <hi>Peruſians</hi> ſpare the Fields of the Biſhop of <hi>Cluſium. (Though dull and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal men, who do not underſtand the worth of Reliques, would be apt to think it had been much better, that this Ring had at first been thrown after one of the Nayles of the Croſs, into the Sea, than that ſuch a stir ſhould have been made about it.)</hi> But the <hi>Peruſians</hi> had reaſon to take more heart, becauſe they were favoured by many great ones, and at that time Cardinal <hi>Fortebrachius</hi> made attempts of war upon the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſes.</hi> The <hi>Peruſians</hi> after this, endeavour to oblige the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Kindred, eſpecially <hi>Hieron. Baſſus</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> who was newly made Cardinal, and favoured their affairs. But they of <hi>Sena,</hi> being perplex'd with many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that befell them, grew more cold in their proſecutions; and ſome at <hi>Rome</hi> gave the <hi>Pope</hi> counſel (which he had alſo before threatned) to demand, that the Ring ſhould be brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and placed in one of the two Houſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Bl. Virgin, which he had repaired: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly by a Letter dated, <hi>Dec.</hi> 18. 1480. the <hi>Pope</hi> deſired the <hi>Peruſians</hi> to deliver the Ring to <hi>J. Baptiſta de Sabellis,</hi> his Cardinal Legat, promiſing to put it in ſome venerable Temple of the City, and to give them holy Reliques in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to their content. But when the Legat came to urge the <hi>Peruſians</hi> to comply with the <hi>Pope</hi>'s deſires, inſtead of anſwering to what he ſaid, they burſt out into teares and howlings, caſt themſelves to the ground before him, and with ſighs, and beating their breaſts, in the moſt pitteous manner, beſeeched and begg'd of him, to implore the favour of the <hi>Pope</hi> on their behalf. He was ſo moved with their teares and ſad complaints, that he became a ſuppliant by his Letters
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52080:35"/>
to the <hi>Pope</hi> on their behalf, which joyned with a moving O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of <hi>Hieron. Riarius,</hi> made the <hi>Pope</hi> alter his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and let the Ring ſtill abide there. Alſo by the <hi>Pope</hi>'s interpoſing, the differences betwixt the <hi>Senenſes</hi> and the <hi>Peruſians</hi> were compoſed, and by agreement, they were to have no more words about the Ring; and <hi>Marcus Barbus</hi> is perſwaded to mitigate by his Authority the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable minds of the <hi>Cluſians.</hi> But while theſe things are menaging, Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. dies; and the Controverſie was not fully decided, till the 3d. Year of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the VIII. <hi>an.</hi> 1486. When, the contending Parties agreed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of ſquabling, to leave the matter to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Piccolominaeus,</hi> who did that which <hi>Eight</hi> Cardinals before could not effect, and the Ring was adjudged to <hi>Peruſia:</hi> who teſtified how welcome the News was which their Embaſſadors brought them by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Bone-fires, and turning the very Night into Day, by Flames and Torches, and ſhowing all other imaginable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now for the greater honor of the ſacred Ring, the <hi>Peruſians</hi> removed it from the <hi>Palatine</hi> Houſe, to a more worthy place; for to this end they built a Chappel in S. <hi>Laurence</hi> his Church; and cauſed this Inſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to be placed on high.</p>

And though he mentions, out of a Book of <hi>Victor de Carben,</hi> a baptized <hi>Jew,</hi> (Printed at <hi>Cohen, an.</hi> 1509.) that the <hi>Jews</hi> take great care, to put the Ring upon the Fore-finger of her that is eſpouſed, becauſe they write, that <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> wore her Ring on the Middle-finger,

                        </note> if we give any credit to <hi>Sulpitius Severus,</hi> who tells us, that under the Reign of <hi>Aurelius</hi> the Son of <hi>Antoninus, tum primùm inter Gallias martyria viſa;</hi> the firſt Martyrdomes in <hi>France</hi> were under his perſecution; long before which the <hi>Areopagite</hi> muſt have been dead; which teſtimony of <hi>Severus</hi> is ſo ſtrong, that even their own men have defended it, and pleaded for a diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Pariſian Dionyſius,</hi> and the <hi>Areopagite;</hi> (ſee <hi>Joh.

But if they were right as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet the Breviaries have made a fabulous ſtory of him, which it would be too tedious to recite in all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but I'le give a taſt, out of the Breviary of <hi>Sarum.</hi> He is ſaid to be ſent into <hi>France,</hi> by Pope <hi>Clemens,</hi> to preach the Goſpel, accompanied with <hi>Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius;</hi> and preaching with great zeal at <hi>Paris,</hi> in the time of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>'s perſecution, they were laid hold of by the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour <hi>Siſinnius,</hi> (the later Breviaries call him <hi>Feſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>) who inflicted various torments on them, and caſt them into priſon; where <hi>S.

Take this, my dear <hi>Denys, (chare me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us)</hi> and incouraged him with the promiſe of great rewards to him and his hearers in God's Kingdom. After this, he and his two Companions refuſing to ſacrifice to the <hi>Heathen</hi> Gods, they were all beheaded in one and the ſame moment, whoſe Tongues, after their Heads were cut off, did ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Lord.

                     <p>And the truth is, if my Faith were ſtaggering upon the hearing Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi>'s ſtory, yet the very next Page to it, would ſettle it again; where he informs us, that S. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> ſaw the H. Ghoſt deſcending from Heaven in the likeneſs of a <hi>Dove:</hi> and the <hi>Sarisbury Breviary</hi> edifies me ſtill farther, telling me, that he ſaw the Holy Spirit in this ſhape twice,<note place="margin">Leſſ. <hi>6.</hi> Of S.

How, when a mighty Beam from the Top of the Church, threatned the deſtruction of many by its fall, S. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> with his right hand, making the ſign of the Croſs, lifts it up again<note n="*" place="bottom">Which may well be credited, when we read of S. <hi>Aidanus,</hi> that his Cart and two Oxen laden with Wood, as he drove them, falling down a high Rock into the Sea, he only made the ſign of the Croſs as they fell, and received all ſafe and ſound out of the Waters.

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52080:45"/>
to ſnatch the Staff out of his hands, upon which the Man of God leaned; he unaffrighted lifts up his Staff, and followed the horrid Monſter beating him, and ſinging theſe words; <hi>Let God ariſe, and let his Enemies be ſcattered,</hi> and the ugly Phantaſme vaniſhed. And no doubt from this Age of S. <hi>Odo</hi>'s Miracle (for it could not ſo well be from any other) came that Tradition to us from Father to Son, in Mr. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant</hi>'s ſure way, how S. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> held the Devil by the noſe with a pair of Tongs.

                  <q>The Steward of S. <hi>Wereburga</hi>'s Monaſtery, complaining that in a Farm that belonged to it, the Corn was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by Flocks of Wild-geeſe: S. <hi>Wereburga</hi> commands the Steward to go and ſhut them all up together in a Houſe. He, though at firſt he wondered at the command, thinking (as any one elſe would have done) that ſhe had ſpoke thoſe words in jeſt; yet perceiving her to renew her command, he went to the Wild-geeſe, which were in great numbers devouring the Corn, and with a loud voice commanded them, in his Miſtreſs's name, to follow him. They obeyed, and all in one Drove were ſhut up together; only one of the Number was privily ſtoln by a Servant, with an intention to eat it. The next Morning the Holy Virgin went to the Houſe, and after ſhe had chidden them
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52080:49"/>
for uſurping that which belonged not to them, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to fly away, and not to return. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the whole Army took Wing; but being ſenſible that one of their Number was wanting, they hovering over the Virgins head, complained of their loſs: ſhe hearing their clamours, underſtood by inſpiration the cauſe of it; and after ſearch, made the Offendor confeſs his theft, and after the Bird was reſtored to her Companions, they all flew away, and not any Bird of that kind was afterward ſeen in that Territory.</q>

                  </note> as Tennis-Balls are toſſed from one to another with a Racket. Thus it is related: S. <hi>Ruada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> obtained this ſpecial favour of God, that from a certain Tree in his Cell (<hi>Tilia</hi> it's call'd) from the Hour of Sun-ſetting to <hi>Nine</hi> a Clock the next Day dropt a Liquor, of a peculiar taſt, pleaſing to every Palate; which then fill'd a Veſſel, which ſufficed for a Dinner for him, and all his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood: and from <hi>Nine</hi> a Clock to Sun-ſetting, it dropt half the Veſſel full, with which Strangers were entertained. Upon the fame of this Miracle, many of the Saints came to S. <hi>Finnian,</hi> deſiring him to go along with them to that place, and perſwade <hi>Ruadanus</hi> to live a life common with others. S. <hi>Finnian</hi> went with them, and when they came to the Tree that gave the admirable Liquor, he ſigned it with the ſign of the Croſs, and after <hi>Nine</hi> a Clock the Liquor ceaſed to flow. S. <hi>Ruadanus</hi> hearing that his Maſter S. <hi>Finian,</hi> and ſeveral others were come to him, he called his Servant, and bad him prepare a Dinner for his Gueſts; who going to the Tree, he ſound the Veſſel that ſtood under it wholly empty, and told his Maſter how it was; who bad him carry his Veſſel to the Fountain, and fill it to the top with Water, which when he had done, preſently the Water was changed into the taſt of that Liquor, that dropt from the Tree: Moreover he found a Fiſh of a great bigneſs in the Fountain, and carried all to the Man of God; who commanded him to ſet theſe Gifts before S. <hi>Finnian.</hi> He ſeeing what was done, croſſed the Liquor, and it was changed again into common Water, and ſaid, Why is this Liquor of a falſe name given to me? The Diſciples of S. <hi>Finnian</hi> ſeeing all this, deſired their Maſter to go to the Fountain and croſs it, as he had done the Tree: <hi>(they had a mind to ſee more of this ſport)</hi> But S. <hi>Finnian</hi> anſwered them; My Brethren, do not grieve this holy Man, for if he go before us to the next Bog,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ad vicinam grunnam: which Colganus explains, not. <hi>17.</hi> ad Vit.

               </p>
               <p>Beſides it ſeems to me a ridiculous thing, and a tempting of God to go to imitate <hi>Elijah</hi> (as it is plain in this thing <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, by propoſing to have it miraculouſly decided) when the caſe and neceſſity is no ways alike, of bringing a People off from Idolatry, to worſhip the true God; and both worſhipping the ſame true God and Saviour, to agree in an uniform obſervance of a Day, or of a Ceremony. Yet a frequent practice this is upon any ſleight occaſion to tell miraculous ſtories of their Saints, bringing in any example of the Scripture, that has any reſemblance to them, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care commonly that the Scripture-inſtance be out-done. To give a few Examples. A pleaſant ſtory they give us of S. <hi>Gonſalvus,</hi> building a Bridg over the River <hi>Tamaca.</hi> And
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52080:53"/>
firſt,<note place="margin">Bolland. vita S. Gonſalvi. <hi>10</hi> Jan. p. <hi>646.</hi>
                  </note> they make the place where he ſhould build it, to be ſhown him by the revelation of an Angel; then how he got Money for his work, particularly of a Gentleman, who paſſed by, of whom <hi>Gonſalvus</hi> asked his Charity towards it; who upon his importunity wrote a Letter to his Wife, to whom he bid him carry it, and ſhe would give him his Almes: the Contents were, that ſhe ſhould give him ſo much Money, as the weight of his Letter came to; which ſhe looking upon as a Jear, wiſhed him to go his way; But <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvus</hi> inſiſted that ſhe ſhould do as her Husband required; and when ſhe weighed the Letter, by a Miracle the weight of it was ſo increaſed, that he got a conſiderable Summe of Money for his Work. After this, wanting Proviſions for his Workmen, upon his Prayers, and making the ſign of the Croſs upon the Waters of the River, a Multitude of Fiſhes covered the ſurface of it, and he taking up as many of them as he needed, ſent the reſt of the Fiſhes away with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and thus he did more than once. And as they were thus wonderfully ſupplied with Food, ſo alſo with Drink; for as another <hi>Moſes</hi> (ſays the ſtory) he with his Staff brought Water out of a Rock (I wonder why River-water might not have ſerved the turn) which became a perpetual Fountain; but now that <hi>Moſes</hi> may be ſure to be out-done, he brought Wine alſo out of the Rock to ſerve their needs, but (as it is wiſely put in) that was dryed up when the Bridg was finiſhed. Another inſtance we have in S. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deus</hi> his going by Sea to the Iſland <hi>Aranu;</hi> He coming to the Sea-ſide,<note place="margin">Colganus vit. S.

S. <hi>Mochua</hi> is another example of the ſame nature;<note place="margin">Bolland. Act. Sanct. <hi>1</hi> Januar. p. <hi>46, 47.</hi>
                  </note> who having a viſit gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him by S. <hi>Kyenanus,</hi> and 15 of his
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:52080:53"/>
Clergy; in their return, they came to an unpaſſable and impetuous River, and wanted a Boat; whereupon S. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chua</hi> ſpread his Mantle upon the Water, being mindful of <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Mantle that divided the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> and <hi>Kyena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and his 15 Men were carried over the River upon this Mantle, as ſafely as in a Veſſel, and it returned back to its owner, without wrinkle or wetting. After this <hi>Mochua</hi> going to the Conſecration of a Church <hi>Kyenanus</hi> had built, he ſaw 12 Harts in a Mountain, and brought them tamely along with him loaden with Wood, and after that with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to boil their Fleſh, upon which they feaſted; only he commanded all their Bones to be reſerved: which the next Day he commanded (in the virtue of him that raiſed <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> from the dead) to riſe in their proper form, and they did ſo; and were ſent away by him alive into the Mountains. This, it's plain, which way ſoever you take it, was a greater Miracle than the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> for his Fleſh was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new created Fleſh, nor devoured: Nay, and upon the ſame account, it is a greater Miracle, than the Reſurrection of <hi>Christ</hi> from the Dead, which is the main confirmation of the Chriſtian Religion; and yet there is no imaginable reaſon for this great Miracle of the Reſurrection of the 12 Staggs. There was ſome little occaſion for their coming along with the Saint, to furniſh the Conſecration Feaſt; but that good work being done, there appears no reaſon at all for that extraordinary Miracle afterwards; unleſs it were to prove the Immortality of Beaſts, as the Reſurrection of our Saviour, and others, was particularly deſigned to prove the Immortality of Men.</p>
               <p>To inſtance only in one more; <hi>viz.</hi> S. <hi>Severus</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>France,</hi> of whom they tell in his Life this Wonder.

                  </note> he heard her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſad moan; he ſtopt, and went in to inquire the cauſe; which was this; That as ſhe was ſetting Bread into her Oven, the Peel was left in it, and was burnt; and ſhe knew not how either to draw out the Loaves that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52080:54"/>
were already in, or put in thoſe that were ſtill out: upon which S. <hi>Severus,</hi> without any dread, went into the hot O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and took in and placed in order the remaining Loaves; and when they were all baked (for he ſtayed in the Oven till then) he reached them all out to the Woman; and came forth, as the <hi>Three Children</hi> out of the Fiery Furnace, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched by the heat, either in his Body or Cloaths. This is ſuch a Rapper, that I cannot but admire at the wanton fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Monks,</hi> thoſe Fathers of Lies, in the invention of this and other Miracles. Can any Man believe, that to ſave an old Womans Batch of Bread, God Almighty ſhould work ſo extraordinary a Miracle, as in ſome circumſtances of it, is beyond that of the <hi>Three Children,</hi> wrought by him in Vindication of his own honour againſt Idolatry? But, in the name of wonder, what need the Biſhop ſtay in the Oven till the Bread was baked? Beſides, I doubt the Criticks will have a hard task to determine, whether of the two we are to believe, either that the Oven was a very large one, or that the Biſhop was very little. Herein then the <hi>Three Children,</hi> and this Saint ſcarce ſtand upon equal terms; but in another reſpect he far out-did them: for S. <hi>Severus</hi> was as miraculouſly preſerved from ſtarving, as from burning <hi>(which we never read of them)</hi> For being ſhut out of doors in a ſad ſnowy Night, having nothing on but Drawers (for he had given away the reſt of his cloaths) a Herd of <hi>Mares</hi> which he uſed to keep in the Field, came round about him, and turning all their heads to him, by their breath kept him warm all Night, and the Snow that came down, all fell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Circle.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this Digreſſion. I am ſure there are Controverſies of more importance, depending betwixt us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than that fore-named was, about the time of obſerving <hi>Eaſter:</hi> If Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi>'s Collection of Wonders, upon far leſs occaſions, were true; methinks we might, without any imputation of ſawcineſs, deſire and hope, that when ſuch ſhowers of Miracles have fallen in the Ages before us, which have made Mountains to ſpring up; we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52080:54"/>
might but have ſome few drops fall upon us, ſuch as would produce at leaſt a Mole-hill. I dare ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, though they have, I believe, more skill to avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheated, yet they are as willing to be determined by a real Miracle, as the old <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Chriſtians were: I know not therefore what ſhould hinder it, unleſs the Prayers of the preſent <hi>Romiſh</hi> Saints, who are the great Pretenders to Miracles, are not ſo acceptable and prevalent with Heaven as heretofore; and I'le give Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> leave to gueſs at the true reaſon of that.</p>

Marinus</hi> the Biſhop of the City, hearing this, ſaid: Let us go with him to the place; and coming to the Cave, they beheld the Servants of God ſitting, and their Faces were as freſh as a Roſe. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored them, and ſent for the Emperour, who when he was come, worſhipped them and wept. Whereupon they ſpake thus to him: For thy ſake our God has raiſed us up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day of the Great Reſurrection, that thou, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther doubting, mighteſt believe the Reſurrection of the Dead. And when they had ſaid thus, they gave up the Ghoſt at God's bidding. Then the Emperor weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and kiſſing their holy Reliques, gathered together a great many Biſhops, and others of the Faithful, who made in the ſame place a worthy Memorial of them.</q>

                           <q>S. <hi>David</hi> before he was born, even while he was yet in his Mothers Womb, was fore-ſhown by God how great a Preacher he ſhould be: for when a certain Maſter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Gildas,</hi> (ſc. <hi>Albanius</hi>) was Preaching to the People, and the Mother of S. <hi>David,</hi> great with Child, entred the Church; <hi>Gildas</hi> of a ſudden held his peace, and preſumed not to Preach any farther. Who when he was asked by the People, why he left off Preaching and was ſilent; he anſwered; that he could have diſcourſed to them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk, but could not Preach; becauſe that Woman,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52080:59"/>
which now by intreaty went out of the Church, came in by a Heavenly warning, while I declared to you the Word of God, to demonſtrate (by my being put to ſilence) the excellency of her off-ſpring.</q> [This paſſage of <hi>Gildas</hi> his being dumb, is farther explained by <hi>Colganus</hi> and <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave;</hi> how that when he could not go on in his Preaching, he deſired all the People to go out of the Church,<note place="margin">Colganus ut ſupra.

But when the Man of God endeavoured to Preach, he could ſtill do nothing; ſo that being amazed at the Miracle, he cryed out, ſaying: If there be any one that lies hid in the Church, I adjure thee by God, that thou ſhow thy ſelf quickly to me. Then ſhe anſwered, Behold here I lye hid. Then ſaid he, Do thou ſtand without Doors, and let the People return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church; which being done, the impediment of his Tongue was looſed, and he Preached as he was wont: and when upon his queſtioning her, ſhe confeſſed her ſelf to be with Child; he by this ſign underſtood and foretold that the Child ſhould be ſo eminent in Sanctity, that none in thoſe Parts ſhould be comparable to him. Thus by childiſh and unlikely circumſtances, they make Prophecies as ridiculous, as they do their Miracles; they intended ſome likeneſs in <hi>Gildas</hi> his dumbneſs, to that of the Father of <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> as I conjecture: but it would have been a ſtrange ſign of his Son's <hi>future Devotion,</hi> if <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſhould have been able to talk of <hi>any affair</hi> with his Neighbours, but ſhould not have been able to ſpeak at all, when he came to ſay <hi>his Prayers;</hi> me-thinks they ſhould have either made <hi>Gildas</hi> wholly dumb, or raiſed his Oratory in Preaching above his common pitch, at the Prefence of him that was to be ſo great a Preacher; eſpecially ſince not being able to go on in a Sermon, when a Man can otherwiſe ſpeak, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to other cauſes than a Divine hinderance.

                           <hi>Monks</hi> will play at ſmall Games, rather than their invention ſhall hold out.

It was therefore agreed, that raiſing a heap of Garments on high, one ſtanding upon them ſhould begin to Preach,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:52080:62"/>
and whoſoever obtained the grace to be heard by all the People, (<hi>Capgrave</hi> ſays, <hi>to be heard by all equally</hi>) he ſhould be all their Metropolitan and Patriarch. Then one of the Biſhops began to Preach, but was ſcarce heard by thoſe that ſtood next him, by reaſon of the Tumult of the People; and ſo it fared with a great many more; at laſt they agree to ſend for S. <hi>David</hi> to preach at the <hi>Synod,</hi> who twice or thrice humbly refuſing; at length he conſented to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but not deſigning to <hi>Preach,</hi> only he told them he would give them ſome aſſiſtance in <hi>Prayer.</hi> But when he came thither, they prevailed with him to Preach; and commanding a Child which attended him, and had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtored to life by him, to ſpread his Handkerchief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Feet, ſtanding upon it,<note place="margin">Sudarium ſuum.</note> he began (ſays Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>) to expound the Goſpel and the Law to the Auditory: All the while that his Oration conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, a Snow-white Dove, deſcending from Heaven, ſate upon his ſhoulders; and moreover the Earth on which he ſtood, raiſed it ſelf under him, till it became a Hill, ſo that he was ſeen by all, and his voice like a Trumpet was equally heard by all, both near and afar off; on the Top of which Hill a Church was afterwards built, which remains to this day. By this Sermon he confounded Hereſie, and eſtabliſht the Orthodox Faith, and by the conſent of all, was made the Arch-Biſhop of all <hi>Brittany. Thus far the story.</hi> Which I think, as to this laſt part, needs not any comment to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim it to be a Fable; that a Hill ſhould here be miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly raiſed, only to ſerve S. <hi>David</hi> for a Pulpit: for though I deny not this to be a good ſubſtantial Miracle, yet me-thinks a Man of Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi>'s wit (if the reſt had none) ſhould have found out a fitter place for it. Had S. <hi>David</hi> been to preach upon <hi>Salisbury Plaines,</hi> there might have been more reaſon for it; but it is not eaſie to imagine how the wit of Man could have hit upon a more pleaſant abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, than to put God Almighty to the expence of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, for the making up the want of a Hill in <hi>Wales.</hi>

                     <p>IT was no doubt a very comfortable time in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, when the Inventions of the Monks could never run on ſo faſt, in wonderous ſtories; but the Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the People could keep pace with them, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther run before them: but the Later Ages have unluckily been given to examine matters more than before, and by <hi>ſcrupling</hi> implicite faith, and <hi>bogling</hi> at contradictions, have put the Writers of that Church to a great deal of trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome work; in defending impoſſible ſtories, and in ſetting a good Gloſs upon Fables, and countenancing long practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Devotions, which in civility to their Fore-fathers, they muſt not <hi>acknowledg</hi> to be either abſurd or impious, though they are really ſo. We have found it ſo in many foregoing inſtances; and this of the Eleven Thouſand Virgins is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable one. For if you call them to an account a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this matter, you'l find little agreement among their Authors, which way to make it look like a probable ſtory; though all of them would fain hold the Concluſion, and have it believed to be true. <q>
                           <hi>Harpsfield</hi> complains ſadly, That the injury of Men and Times,<note place="margin">Harpsfi ld. Hiſt. Eccl. Anglic. p. <hi>35.</hi>
                           </note> has deprived us of the accurate and exact knowledg of this matter, as well as of many other things, inſtead of which, certain idle People, abuſing their leaſure ſhamefully, and the too forward cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity

of the Age they lived in <hi>(an excellent character of the former Monks)</hi> have obtruded meer Fables, and thoſe too perfectly diſagreeing one from another; and have forced us that live ſo many Ages after, to follow not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth, but ſlender conjectures.</q> And yet <hi>(ſee the power of a strong faith above reaſon!)</hi> the ſame Author there breaks out into this expreſſion. <q>Would to God that the Hiſtory of <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> were ſo certain and free from difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as I eaſily and certainly perſwade my ſelf, that ſhe and her Companions are bleſſed Martyrs in Heaven.</q> If the Hiſtory of them be not certain, then there is nothing left, but Tradition to ground his certainty of Perſwaſion upon, that they were at all in being, or that they were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; and if he is forced to rely upon Tradition for this which is the main thing, why not for the reſt too, without taking the needleſs pains of conjecturing uncertainly about them? he was bound to it in civility, unleſs the ſtory that Tradition tells, prove impoſſible; and his not following it throughout, argues that he thought it ſo: but any one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that nature does our work; for a witneſs loſes his credit in the whole, when he would obtrude an abſurd or impoſſible thing upon our faith.

                     <p>When <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant in his Invaſion of <hi>Gaul,</hi> had expelled the Inhabitants of <hi>Armorica,</hi> he invites a Colony over thither of <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Souldiers, and ſettles them there, and thence it was called <hi>Little-Brittany:</hi> And now the next care was, to get Wives for them in their own Country. <hi>

                     <p>This account Mr. <hi>Creſſy</hi> can by no means allow, and gives theſe Reaſons: (or his Friend <hi>Alford</hi> for him.) Becauſe <hi>Maximus</hi> his ſhort Reign,<note place="margin">Ch. Hiſt. l. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>20.</hi>

Beſides the <hi>French Hiſtorians</hi> refer the erecting of a Principality of <hi>Brittains</hi> in <hi>Armorica</hi> to a much Later Date, when <hi>Meroveus</hi> was King of the <hi>Francks,</hi> which was <hi>An.</hi> 448.

Let us now ſee what Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> gives us in the room of it. He agrees with <hi>Baronius</hi> in the main ſubſtance of the Hiſtory; only differs from him in the following particulars. He has placed their ſlaughter in the Year 453. when <hi>Attila</hi> King of the <hi>Hunns</hi> waſted <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Weſtern Regions: he makes it to happen in the days of <hi>Maximus</hi> the Tyrant, but not of him who ſlew the Emperor <hi>Gratianus,</hi> but of that <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> who invaded the Empire, and ſucceeded <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and appointed <hi>Avitus</hi> to oppoſe thoſe Barbarous People. He has joyned together <hi>two</hi> occaſions, why this numerous Company of Virgins departed out of their Countrey: the one was, the fore-named deſign of Marrying their own Country-men in <hi>Armorica,</hi> (or <hi>Little Brittany</hi>) the other occaſion was, the Cruelty exerciſed upon the <hi>Brittans</hi> by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were firſt called in by <hi>Vortigern</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Brittans</hi> againſt the <hi>Picts,</hi> but after making Peace with them, turned their Arms againſt their Benefactors, and exerciſed all manner of cruelties upon them, and made many fly the Land, among whom he ſuppoſes theſe 11000 Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins. A very pretty conjecture! but yet not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to plead for the truth of their ſtory, nor to juſtifie the Devotions of the Church to them. For as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended cauſe of their Voyage, from their intended Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in <hi>Armorica;</hi> their own <hi>Harpsfield</hi> has plainly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly confeſſed, <q>That he ſhould eaſily acquieſce in this Narration, but that they who are of this Opinion, bring no certain and approved Author that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies about this Marriage;<note place="margin">Harpsf.

                           </note> and, ſays he, though I my ſelf have laboured never ſo, I could never yet light upon any, that has any teſtimony of Antiquity and fidelity; only I have ſeen an <hi>Anonymous Brittan,</hi> tranſlated by <hi>Geoffrey</hi> into Latine, that ſays ſome ſuch thing; but he is a man, who as in many other things,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52080:66"/>
ſo in this Narration concerning the affairs of <hi>Maximus,</hi> is guilty of more than one lye.</q> [From whence, by the way, one may conclude that the Teſtimony cited by ſome out of <hi>Sigebert,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Surius, and the old Rom. Breviary.</note> concerning that intended Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, was not looked upon by him as an Authentick Authority, but as an Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop <hi>

He does not ſee in the foregoing narration any just cauſe of Martyrdome:</hi> (and yet you know, the thing that Church celebrates them for, is for their being Martyrs.) He was ſo wiſe, as not to think that a <hi>Maſſacre</hi> meerly made a <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> for then he knew that <hi>Hereticks</hi> (in his ſence) might boaſt of numbers beyond Eleven Thouſand, and that one in his time at <hi>Paris,</hi> would then have out-vied <hi>Colen:</hi> and all the account that the ſtory he oppoſes gave farther, was only, that theſe ſlaughtered Perſons were <hi>Virgins;</hi> but that could not make them <hi>Martyrs</hi> neither, becauſe it will not alone make any one a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> and in <hi>this caſe,</hi> their Virginity was the leſs conſiderable alſo, becauſe they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no longer to be fam'd for that ſort of Chaſtity, than till they could get good Husbands, which they were now in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52080:67"/>
Queſt after. But Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> ſeems to rely more upon the ſtory of the <hi>Saxons</hi> barbarous uſage, which firſt gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the flight of theſe Virgins, and after to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them by the <hi>Hunns.</hi> But, whatſoever he may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in his performance, I think he has no ways aſſoyled the Objections that lye againſt this account too. For is it credible, that what is pretended to be acted in the <hi>middle of an Age,</hi> ſhould not ſo much as be mentioned by one who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>in that very Age,</hi> and wrote about this very matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction of the <hi>Brittans</hi> by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> at the end of it?

I ſee indeed Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to apologize for this omiſſion, but ſo pittiful are the excuſes he makes, that I wonder he had the confidence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them. As for <hi>Gildas,</hi> he ſays, <q>his deſign being to bewail the general deſtruction of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> ſtate,<note place="margin">Gh. Hiſt l. <hi>9.</hi> cap. <hi>22.</hi>
                           </note> and to declare the horrible crimes that provoked Almighty God, to give them up to the fury of a barbarous People; no wonder if he did not in ſo ſhort a narration, involve occurrents happening a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</q> Not <hi>every occurrent,</hi> I grant, that happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; but ſuch as were <hi>remarkably deſtructive,</hi> one would think he might; eſpecially ſuch a one as this was, being a ſtory, ſuch as no Age, I think, can parallel, either for the number of Virgins ſlain (Eleven Thouſand in one Day and Place) or for the barbarous fury of thoſe that ſlew them (which he confeſſes was one part of <hi>Gildas</hi> his deſign Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically to expreſs) nor any particular <hi>occurrent</hi> that gave ſuch a deadly blow to the <hi>Brittiſh state;</hi> and he muſt ſure be in great haſt, and affect ſtrange Brevity, that could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the place of one Line in his Book for ſuch a ſtory, which though acted <hi>abroad,</hi> yet not at that diſtance, but that the report of it would quickly arrive, and ring aloud in the ears of thoſe, that were ſo much concerned in it <hi>at home.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> would perſwade us, that <hi>Gildas</hi> has general ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that ſeem to point at their ſtory,<note place="margin">Ch.

                        </q> I never thought before, that when one is dividing a <hi>remnant</hi> of People, and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the ſeveral miſeries of them ſo divided, that <hi>Nonnulli</hi> or <hi>alii,</hi> could be tranſlated <hi>very many;</hi> rather of the two it might be Engliſht <hi>ſome few:</hi> but the other tranſlation was neceſſary for his purpoſe, of Eleven Thouſand Virgins go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away at once in one company.

                     <p>Here firſt, it is worth obſerving, that the Late <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers are much more inclinable, I perceive, to follow the Traditional account, than the other: (only excepting the Jeſuite <hi>Alford,</hi> who writing a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> thought it not ſo proper to mention Revelations; and living, as he ſays, among Heterodox Perſons (being then in <hi>England</hi>) he thought that telling ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Miracles,<note place="margin">Alford.

followed <hi>Baronius</hi> and our <hi>Geoffrey;</hi> yet when his Book was Printed at <hi>Colen</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> an. 1630. they put out that Life of his, and inſerted another, after the Traditional way: For ſo the Reader, before that life, is admoniſhed; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that,<note place="margin">Ribud.

                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> by an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from the Lord, that they ſhould go to <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence returning thither, ſhe with her Spouſe and all the Company, ſhould come to glory by Martyrdome. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore from the City of <hi>Colen</hi> to <hi>Baſil</hi> by Water, they went from thence to <hi>Rome</hi> a Foot. All which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were received with joy and honour by Pope <hi>Ciriacus</hi> and his Clergy, for he himſelf was of <hi>Brittany,</hi> and had ſome Kindred among the Virgins; and to him who was himſelf a Virgin, it was revealed, that he ſhould obtain the reward of Martyrdome with them. When therefore they had ſtayed ſome while there at <hi>Rome,</hi> Pope <hi>Ciriacus</hi> cauſed ſome of them, that had not yet obtained the grace of Baptiſme, to be baptized. And at length declaring his mind before all the Clergy, he renounced the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, after he had governed the Church one Year and about <hi>three</hi> Months, being the 19th. in ſucceſſion after <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the Apoſtle: which thing was taken ill by the Clergy, who knew not the Counſel of God, that leaving the Seat of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he ſhould go after that Multitude of Women. Therefore by common advice they choſe another called <hi>Antheros,</hi> removing this <hi>Ciriacus</hi> out of the Catalogue of Biſhops.</q>

                           <p>BEfore this glorious Company parted from <hi>Brittany,</hi> we are told that they ſpent <hi>three</hi> Years in pretty Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous exerciſes upon the Sea,<note place="margin">Vit. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulae apud Surium.</note> which was hard by.

In which there were <hi>two</hi> things very wonderful; that they were <hi>preludes</hi> to their <hi>Martyrdome:</hi> and that they ended in the <hi>Converſion</hi> of all the Virgins to the Faith:<note place="margin">Cum multa jucunditate cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brato per triennium hoc Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrii praeludio. <hi>Surius.</hi>

their peeviſh crying diſturb the Company: Troops of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels preſented themſelves to them, and appeared <hi>above</hi> and <hi>round about</hi> them; inſomuch that the little Infants that were carried in armes, admiring the Viſions of Angels, and their unuſual and ſhining Effigies, pointing with their Fingers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Aire <hi>(and at this ſight no doubt they would leave ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them)</hi> teſtified their wonder by the pleaſant noyſes of <hi>Ha, Ha.</hi> (and it's hard methinks to forbear imitating them upon the report of it.) You need not wonder if they made a quick Voyage, when Angels thus attended them, though they went againſt the ſwift ſtream of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for that which would have coſt others above <hi>Eight</hi> Days time, they did it in <hi>two</hi> Days and an half, and came ſafe to <hi>Colen:</hi> but they ſtayed not there; for upon a new Viſion to <hi>

                           <p>The next thing we are to remark, is, that all this Company
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52080:77"/>
came ſafe and ſound to <hi>Rome;</hi> where the Pope <hi>(Ciriacus)</hi> with his Cardinals and Clergy, Princes, Matrons and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, Citizens and common People, with great joy, and a Noble Proceſſion,<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Richard.</hi> Ibid. p. 322, 323.</note> worthily received them: where while they ſtayed, ſome of them, (that were new Converts) were baptized, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, among the more Noble, S. <hi>Lucia</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſia,</hi> two Kings Daughters, and both of Kin to <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi>'s Spouſe. And now they bethink themſelves of their return to <hi>Colen.</hi> (after they had viſited the holy Places at <hi>Rome,</hi> and paid their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions there.) And here comes in that paſſage, which has created much controverſie and trouble to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, concerning Pope <hi>Ciriacus,</hi> his laying down his Office, to accompany them; which we are told, he was incited to do by a Viſion of <hi>three</hi> Saints in white, promiſing him if he did ſo, an Eternal Crown of Martyrdome, and threatning that if he continued ſtill at <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſhould quickly dye. Whereupon (as S. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s viſions inform us) <q>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the Popedome in the face of the whole Church, all Men crying out againſt it, and gain-ſaying it, eſpecially the Cardinals, who looked upon it as a piece of madneſs for him to go after theſe fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Women (<hi>as indeed any one would have judged,</hi>

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conjecture is, that the <hi>Sunici</hi> (an ancient People in <hi>Germany,</hi> by the River <hi>Rhine</hi>) were they that ſlaughtered them; and in following times (theſe being leſs known) the Tranſcribers of the ſtory, put the word <hi>Hunni,</hi> (a People more known) inſtead of <hi>Sunici.</hi> But there is another fancy ſtill, which he ſeems to lay more ſtreſs upon, that the <hi>Hunns</hi> in <hi>Attila</hi>'s time having deſtroyed all before them, their Name was ſo terrible in the after Age or two, (for he would have their ſtory in <hi>Surius</hi> to be written between 6 and 700 Years after Chriſt) that all things cruelly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly acted, were ſaid to be done by the <hi>Hunns:</hi> which is ſo clear a ſolution, that it's pitty any one ſhould offer a word againſt it.

                     <p>

                     <p>In the Raign of <hi>Maxentius Caeſar,</hi> there was in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> a beautiful Maid, Twenty two Years old, called <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> the only Daughter of King <hi>Coſtus,</hi> one who was very Religious and very Learned, both in Divine and Humane Philoſophy, and skilful in the Languages of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, living, after her Fathers death, in his Palace, ſeeking only to be eſpouſed to Chriſt, and beſtowing all to the poor, ſave what was neceſſary to the maintenance of her Self and Family. [Neither muſt that be omitted which <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> mentions out of <hi>Petrus de Natalibus;</hi> (and I wonder how it came to be left out of this Leſſon) that before S. <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> was baptized, ſhe ſaw one Night in a Viſion the Bl. Virgin with Chriſt in her Arms,<note place="margin">Ribadeneira flos Sanctor. in vit. S. Cath. p. <hi>364.</hi>
                        </note> who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Katherine</hi> to her Son, he turned his face from her, as if he abominated her, and denied her to be fair, that was not yet baptized.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52080:87"/>
Whereupon <hi>Katherine</hi> awaking, perceiving what ſhe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to make her acceptable to Chriſt, was baptized. Then Chriſt appeared again to her in the ſame form as before, and eſpouſed her to himſelf before his Mother and a numerous company of Heavenly Spirits, and gave her a Ring as a pledg of his eſpouſing her, which S. <hi>Katherine,</hi> awaking, found upon her Finger.]</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Maxentius</hi> coming to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> commanded all Perſons to offer Sacrifices to the Gods. This Virgin being troubled to ſee many Chriſtians, through fear, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to confeſs Chriſt, boldly ſpeaking to the Emperour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to him againſt his falſe Gods, and concerning the Knowledge of the true God the Creator of all things; who being moved by her reaſoning, and more amazed at her beauty, commanded her to be carried into his Palace.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 3. Where upon diſcourſe with her, finding himſelf unable to maintain an Argument againſt her, he cauſed 50 Philoſophers to be aſſembled, to diſpute with her: Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incouraged by an Angel to undertake them all, ſhe did ſo; and was too hard for them in diſputation: upon which the Emperour, in great indignation, commanded them all to be burnt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 4. Who as they were led to Execution, humbled themſelves before the Virgin, confeſſing their ſins in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting her ſacred admonitions, and profeſſing themſelves to be Chriſtians, ſigned themſelves with the Croſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Fire; but God miraculouſly preſerved their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies untoucht, as he did the <hi>Three Children,</hi> and received their Souls. Then the Emperour attempted her by flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and large promiſes of making her a <hi>Queen;</hi> but ſhe reſiſting them all, he commanded her to be ſtripped of her cloths and chaſtized with Scorpions, and to be ſhut up in a dark Priſon 12 days without any food: but ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by the viſit of an Angel, and a white <hi>Dove</hi> brought her proviſions to ſuſtain her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 5. The <hi>Queen</hi> mean-while, pittying the miſeries ſhe was condemned to, by means of <hi>Porphyrius</hi> (the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52080:87"/>
of the <hi>Militia</hi>) who bribed the Guards, ſhe with <hi>Porphyry</hi> give S. <hi>Katherine</hi> a viſit in the Priſon, and beheld her there ſhining with ineſtimable brightneſs, and upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſhe converted them both to Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 6. After this, the Emperour cauſed <hi>four</hi> Wheels to be prepared ſtuck with ſharp Irons, (as we ſee in the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the <hi>Catherine Wheel)</hi> two of which were to turn one way, and the other two the contrary way, and ſo tear her fleſh in pieces: but when ſhe was brought forth thus to be puniſht, upon her prayer, an Angel deſcending from Heaven, broke the Wheels in pieces, and ſlew 4000 of the Heathens.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. All which the <hi>Queen</hi> beholding, and deſiring her Husband to take notice, how powerful the God of the Chriſtians was, He in great indignation to ſee her made a Chriſtian, commanded her Breaſts to be torn off with Iron Hooks; which ſhe, being heartned by S. <hi>Katherine,</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully underwent, and both <hi>She</hi> and <hi>Porphyry</hi> were beheaded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 9. Then when the Emperour found all means unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful to move <hi>Katherine,</hi> he commanded her alſo to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed; who coming to the place, and obtaining reſpite to make her prayers to God, ſhe ſaid thus. O Lord Jeſu Chriſt, I deſire of Thee, that all Chriſtians, who in any tribulation ſeeking my Patronage, cry to Thee, that thou who art bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever, wouldſt hear them. Then a Voice coming from Heaven, ſaid, Thy Prayer is heard; and ſo her Head was ſtruck off, on the 25 of <hi>November.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Immediately, in token of her pure Virginity, inſtead of Blood, Milk flowed from her Body upon the Earth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Her Body was carried by Angels, and placed on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where many Miracles are wrought, upon the Invocation of this Saint. For from her Grave a Fountain of Oyl perpetually flows forth, with which the Bodies of infirm People being anointed, to their great joy they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to ſoundneſs.</p>

                     <p>ONE that reads this Formal ſtory of a Saint, whoſe life is placed about the Year 300 after Chriſt, might well expect that ſome of the ancient Writers ſhould have given us a fair account of a Hiſtory ſo famous, and whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, if they were true, are highly remarkable. But alas! <hi>Baronius</hi> has ſpoiled all this expectation,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. <hi>307.</hi> ſec. <hi>33.</hi>
                        </note> where he complains that they were pretermitted by <hi>Euſebius;</hi> and, which is worſe, that her <hi>Acts</hi> were written largely by an uncertain Author, but leſs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than was meet; and gravely adds, <hi>Melius conſulitur Eccleſiaſticae veritati, &amp;c.</hi> 
                        <q>They provide better for the truth of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, who paſs over in ſilence things that are uncertain, than ſuch as tell any lye, though never ſo ſpecious, and mixed with ſome truths: for the mind reſts ſatisfied in thoſe few truths, and by probable conjectures, leaning upon truth, can conceive and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and contemplate the reſt: But in the other caſe, the mind of the Reader being once offended with a lye (though but a little one) becomes doubtful and wavering, and knows not where to fix a ſure footing, but having once ſtumbled upon a lye, ſuſpects even truths themſelves.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A very obſervable <hi>Memorandum</hi> this is for Proteſtants, who may therefore the better be excuſed, having met ſo often in the lives of their Saints, not little but loud untruths, if they be very cautious what they aſſent to, (and much more when it comes to be a ground of their Prayers,) eſpecially when the late Author of <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> has ſo horribly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in his Attempt to eſtabliſh them by Tradition. I think this of S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is as remarkable
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52080:89"/>
an Inſtance as any; which may well be looked upon, from the beginning to the end, as a <hi>Fiction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We need not go much farther than to their own <hi>Caſſander</hi> to prove it;<note place="margin">Caſſandri opera p. <hi>278.</hi>
                        </note> who ſhews, that the very Name of <hi>Catherine</hi> was not known to the <hi>Latines</hi> above 300 Years ſince at moſt; nor known to the <hi>Greeks</hi> (from whom the <hi>Latines</hi> derived the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her) much ſooner. <hi>Euſebius</hi> that writ diligently the affairs of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and lived about the ſame time that her Acts are recorded, ſays nothing of her, nor <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus</hi> who lived after that, nor any of the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians.</hi> All the <hi>Martyrologies, Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, Eccleſiaſtical Offices</hi> of any Antiquity, are wholly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this matter. Even <hi>Aldelm</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> in the Books he writ on ſet purpoſe in praiſe of the famous Virgins of both Sexes, has paſſed her over; which he could not have done, if her fame had either been ſo great as now, or her Name known: neither is ſhe to be met with in S. <hi>Jerome's Kalendar,</hi> or in <hi>Bede's Martyrologie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, the truth of Hiſtory contradicts what is told of her: eſpecially when ſhe is ſaid to be put to death by <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereas he paſſed the time of his whole Reign, or Tyranny, at <hi>Rome.</hi> She is ſaid to be a <hi>Kings</hi> Daughter, whereas <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all <hi>Egypt,</hi> from the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Victory at <hi>Actium,</hi> was reduced into a <hi>Province.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſtory of her Father <hi>Coſtus,</hi> how he was born at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> a City of <hi>Germany,</hi> and warred under the King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and afterwards when the King dyed, was choſen to be King in his room; that he was called <hi>Coſtus,</hi> becauſe he came from <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which in the <hi>German</hi> Tongue is called <hi>Coſtnitz;</hi> theſe (ſays he) are all ſo abſurd, that they deſerve no Confutation. See farther what <hi>Caſſander</hi> adds concerning the deriving of her Name and Worſhip to the <hi>Latines,</hi> out of a certain Book, <hi>De ortu S.

                     <p>Now let us farther obſerve, what work they have made ſince the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> in Reforming the <hi>Roman Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> as to this Legend of S. <hi>Katherine;</hi> from whence we may better conjecture, how rarely <hi>Popes</hi> are wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form things amiſs. In the <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the V. Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> 1580. the old Prayer <hi>(Deus qui dediſti le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, &amp;c.)</hi> is ſtill retained, and all the ſubſtance of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend, though not made ſo large; only the name of King <hi>Coſtus</hi> is left out, the <hi>Queen</hi> is now named <hi>Fauſtina, Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines</hi> prodigious Learning is determined to be at 18 Years of Age; one Wheel is ſaid to be prepared for her torments inſtead of four; the 4000 ſlain by the Angel, the Milk and Oyl flowing after her Death, and the voice from Heaven, are left out: And as in other Lives, the Names of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are ſet down uſually, at the beginning, out of which they are taken; ſo here is prefixed, <hi>Euſebius, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 26. That which has been done ſince that time by ſucceeding <hi>Popes,</hi> is this; That in the preſent <hi>Breviaries,</hi> the quotation of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> which was both falſe, and nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is omitted; (which, by the way, I obſerve is now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally practiſed in moſt of the Lives of the Saints; the Authors are not quoted out of which they are taken, and it
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52080:90"/>
has this cunning in it, that now the falſities cannot ſo eaſily be diſcovered) now alſo, after the diligence and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Baronius</hi> upon the <hi>Martyrologie,</hi> in every place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Maxentius,</hi> is put, the Emperour <hi>Maximinus;</hi> the Name of <hi>Fauſtina</hi> is omitted; the number of Philoſophers not determined to be 50 as before; but inſtead of it is put <hi>many Philoſophers:</hi> and yet all the circumſtances of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as it is in the old <hi>Breviary,</hi> have the ſame Authority of Tradition, and long uſage in the Church; which, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> and his Brethren of the Scientifical way, is a hundred times more Infallible than any <hi>Pope.</hi> And for my part, I look upon the Milk and Oyl as the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious part of the ſtory; nor can I altogether excuſe the <hi>Pope</hi> from raſhneſs, in taking away <hi>three</hi> of the Wheels, for who knows what myſtery may be in them? However, this good uſe may be made of theſe <hi>two</hi> great Examples, the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> to believe as much of any Legend, as every Man thinks fit.</p>
                     <p>Now though theſe alterations ſignifie not much, yet in one particular, theſe <hi>Popes</hi> may ſhame Mr. <hi>Creſſy,</hi> if he be capable of it: <hi>viz.</hi> In their leaving out the miraculous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of her chaſtity, the Milk when her Head was cut off ſtreaming from her Body inſtead of Blood.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. <hi>Cr.</hi> had been of the Council, he would by no means, I dare ſay, have conſented to this omiſſion: for he has, in his Church-Hiſtory, commended ſome for living like <hi>Virgins,</hi> and others for preſerving even their Virginity, in a ſtate of Marriage. <q>Thus <hi>Ethelfleda,</hi> he ſays, was of ſuch chaſtity,<note place="margin">Ch.

For, to inſtance in S. <hi>Katherine;</hi> was there ever a more dull deſcant upon ſuch a Subject, as her being carried by Angels to be buried on the top of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> than to pray, <hi>that we, by her Merits and Interceſſion, may come to the Mount, which is Christ?</hi> And could the Romance of S. <hi>Denys,</hi> raiſe their requeſts to no higher a ſtrain, than ſuch general deſires, <hi>that we may imitate him, by deſpiſing proſperity, and not fearing adverſity?</hi> Or that, of <hi>Hippolytus</hi> his being drawn to death by wild Horſes, than, <hi>that his venerable ſolemnity may increaſe both Devotion and Salvation?</hi> If <hi>our</hi> Men had been in their place, and had felt their Devotions flagging and ſinking in this manner; we ſhould have heard, to be ſure, of <hi>their</hi> keeping Days, to humble themſelves for the loſs of ſuch <hi>pretious opportunities,</hi> and for not thriving under ſuch <hi>fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſpenſations,</hi> bewailing their unthankfulneſs for <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine mercies,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher mercies,</hi> and bemoaning their barrenneſs under them.</p>

                     <p>THE <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in the Firſt Leſſon on the Tranſlation of <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſays, <q>That <hi>Pope Honorius</hi> III. granted ſuch Indulgences, to thoſe that came Yearly to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52080:101"/>
ſolemnize his Tranſlation, as we never remember any <hi>Popes</hi> in former times to have afforded.</q> Which ſeems to me to give great ſuſpicion, that <hi>Thomas</hi> was more the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Martyr than <hi>Christ</hi>'s: for elſe, he might have found fitter occaſions for theſe liberal grants, from thoſe many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sufferers for <hi>Christ,</hi> who made a more glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of him, than ever <hi>Thomas</hi> did.</p>
                     <p>But to make the evidence of this undoubted, and to ſhow in this inſtance, not only the Abſurdity, but Impiety of the foregoing Devotions, it will be requiſite to give as ſhort an Account of his ſtory as I can; by preſenting the Reader (out of their own Authors, eſpecially <hi>Baronius</hi>) with the firſt occaſion of the Quarrel betwixt him and his Prince; to what height the Conteſt was afterward carried; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mediations for agreement, and the cauſe of their being unſucceſsful; and the Concluſion of all in the death of this Prelate, whom (as the Prayer told us) they would make a glorious Martyr. And when all this is done, we ſhall find, I believe, more of a <hi>Rebel</hi> in him than a <hi>Saint,</hi> and ſee the moſt extravagant abuſe in the <hi>Pope,</hi> of a pretended power to Canonize,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> The occaſion of the Quarrel.</note> that ever was. For the firſt: 1. The occaſion of the Quarrel between him and <hi>King Henry the Second; Neubrigenſis,</hi> who lived at this very time, tells us expreſly, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between them aroſe <hi>Super praerogativa Ordinis Clericalis,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neubrig. de reb. Angl. l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> about the Prerogatives of Clergy-men. For the King being buſied about the Affairs of the Realm, and commanding Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, without any difference, to be extirpated, it was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to him by the Judges, that many Thefts, Rapines, Homicides, againſt the publick Diſcipline, were committed by the Clergy, whom the vigour of Common Laws was not permitted to reach. <hi>Baronius</hi> acknowledges, that a Prieſt that had committed Murder,<note place="margin">Baron. Annal. ad An. <hi>1163.</hi> p. <hi>482.</hi>
                        </note> was thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Monaſtery, after he was degraded, but <hi>Thomas</hi> would not deliver him to the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Courts. But <hi>Neubrigenſis</hi> ſays, that it was declared to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52080:101"/>
the King, that more than a Hundred Murders were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Clergy of <hi>England.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Neubrig. Ibid.</note> Thus alſo the riſe of the Quarrel is repreſented by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in their Letters to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Baron. ad an. <hi>1167.</hi> p. <hi>546.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <q>That the King finding the Peace of his Kingdom much moleſted, by the outragious exceſſes of ſome inſolent Clerks, he referred their Crimes to the Biſhops, the Judges of the Church, that one Sword might aſſiſt another; but the Biſhops perſiſted in this judgment, that Murder, and any other like Crime, ſhould only be puniſht in the Clergy by Degradation; the King on the other ſide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Opinion, that this puniſhment did not condignly anſwer the Offence; neither was it ſufficient proviſion for maintaining Peace, if a <hi>Reader,</hi> or <hi>Acoluthus,</hi> killing a Man famous for Religion or Dignity, ſhould eſcape only with the loſs of his Order.</q> Now I dare appeal to any honeſt <hi>Turk</hi> or <hi>Heathen,</hi> whether in this firſt occaſion of contending, the King had not apparently more of the zeal of a Saint in him, than the Arch-Biſhop. For did ever any Saint before this, put in for an exemption of any Men from Death in the caſe of Murder? Can there be any pretence that their puniſhment ſhould be leſs than that of others, who committing the ſame enormous Crimes, yet deſerve leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, becauſe they muſt needs ſin with greater malice, and by the example of their Vices do greater miſchief? <hi>If I have spoken evil,</hi> ſays our Saviour himſelf, <hi>bear witneſs of the evil.</hi> He was only concerned,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.23.</note> that he might not be ſmitten when he was innocent; but if any plain proof, either of his ſaying, or doing wickedly, could have been brought againſt him, no doubt he would have made no exception againſt any Legal Court that had tryed him, though it had been any other than that of <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> I once read indeed of an Apoſtle of his that appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but of none in any caſe that ever appealed from him. And I dare ſay, no true Martyr among the Primitive Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, would have deſired for any Prieſt under him, that had
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52080:102"/>
been a Thief, or a Murderer, that he might have had the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his <hi>Clergie. Neubrigenſis</hi> in this caſe, ſpeaks not ſo much like a Politician (as <hi>Stapleton</hi> would traduce him) as like a good Man that was ſenſible of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of ſuch exemptions,<note place="margin">Qui homo magis Politicus fuit, quam monachum, aut clericum, aut bonum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianum decuit. Stapleton de <hi>3</hi> Thomis. p. <hi>26.</hi>
                        </note> when he expreſſes himſelf thus. <q>The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops whilſt they are watchful ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to defend the Liberties and Dignities of the Clergy, than to correct and cut off their Vices, think they do God and the Church good ſervice, when they defend the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy againſt the publick Diſcipline, whom accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duty of their Office,<note place="margin">Neubrig. loc. citat.</note> they have either no mind or neglect to reſtrain with the vigour of Canonical cenſure; whence it comes to paſs, that Clergy-men, who being called into the Lord's Lot, ought in Life and Doctrine to ſhine upon Earth, as Stars placed in the Firmament of Heaven, taking Licence and Liberty, through impunity, to do whatſoever they pleaſe, reverence neither God, whoſe Judgment ſeems to linger, nor Men that are in Authority; when the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal care about them languiſhes, and the Prerogative of their Holy Order ſhall exempt them from Secular Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</q>

The King being vexed at theſe Reports, demands of the Arch-Biſhop, that ſuch of the wicked Clergy,<note place="margin">Baron. Ibid. p. <hi>482.</hi>
                        </note> after the inflicting Canonical Penance, might be delivered to the Secular Court; which he refuſed to grant: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King, being very angry, asked him, and the reſt of the Prelates, whether they would obſerve his Regal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, obſerved by Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, private and priviledged Perſons, in his Grand-father's time: to which <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered, that he would, <hi>Salvo ordine ſuo,</hi> ſaving his Order; only <hi>Hilary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> ſaid, he would
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52080:102"/>
obſerve them, <hi>bona fide,</hi> without that reſervation. The King told <hi>Thomas</hi> that his Anſwer was captious, and required him to promiſe abſolutely without any addition, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. The <hi>Pope,</hi> being advertized of all theſe proceedings by <hi>Thomas,</hi> wrote Letters to the Biſhops, that by vertue of their Canonical obedience to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhould not attempt any thing againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Liberty, nor engage themſelves in any Promiſe or Oath, ſave that which Biſhops uſe to make to their Kings; and that if they had promiſed any thing of that kind to him, they ſhould not obſerve but revoke it, and reconcile themſelves to God and the Church.</p>
                     <p>After this was a Meeting at <hi>Clarendon</hi> of the King, Biſhops, and Lords of the Realm,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. <hi>1164.</hi>
                        </note> where the Ancient Cuſtomes were produced, and <hi>Thomas</hi> having made a promiſe at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to change the words that offended the King, was then challenged with his promiſe, which at firſt he refuſed to perform; but after by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement urging of ſome Biſhops and Nobles, that he would not too ſtifly oppoſe the King, declaring the danger of it, he was perſwaded to give his conſent, <hi>Bona fide,</hi> to obſerve the Regal Cuſtomes, and ſwore to it as the reſt did; but yet refuſed to ſet his Seal to it. This Oath very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him after the taking of it, being ſenſible how the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Liberties were invaded by it, and he reſolves, as his Penance, to deſiſt from the Exerciſe of his Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But the <hi>Pope</hi> quickly abſolves him from his Oath, requiring Him not to forbear Celebrating Maſs upon this account.</p>
                     <p>But the King,<note place="margin">Bar. Ib. p. <hi>488.</hi>
                        </note> upon his Refuſal to Seal the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, was more incenſed, ſought by his Meſſengers to the <hi>Pope</hi> to hinder him from being his Legat, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally was beſtowed upon the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and to confer it on the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Pope</hi> to confirm the Cuſtomes of <hi>Clarendon.</hi> The <hi>Pope</hi> grants his requeſt as to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> but refuſes to confirm the other: and writes to <hi>Thomas</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have

himſelf prudently, and diſcreetly, and yieldingly to the King, and to do all to ſweeten him, and regain his favour, that was conſiſtent with the honeſty of his Eccleſiaſtical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                           <hi>pag.</hi> 490.</note> though driven back at Sea by croſs Winds. He is ſummoned to a <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Northampton,</hi> by the King: There in the Morning before the Meeting, he cauſed the Maſs to begin with the words proper to S. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>'s Day, (though it was not his day) <hi>Princes ſate, and spake againſt me, &amp;c.</hi> [a good beginning to ſweeten the King.] When he was called to give his anſwer to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt him, he declined the judgment of the Court, appealed to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and ſo departed; who as he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, was followed with the cries of thoſe that called him <hi>Traytor.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> told him plainly, <hi>You were ſometimes our Arch-Biſhop, whom we were bound to obey; but, becauſe you have ſworn Fidelity to our Lord the King, and to keep the Cuſtomes which he requires, and you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deſtroy them, though tending to his Worldly Dignity and Honour; we therefore pronounce you guilty of Perjury, and we are not bound any longer to obey a Perjured Arch-Biſhop.</hi>

                     <p>But the fineſt contrivance, methinks, is that wonder for a ſpecial Friend of <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Antoninus ibid.</note> who being under an infirmity, came to the Tomb of the Saint, to pray for the recovery of his health, which, ſays the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he received to the full. But being returned home, he thought within himſelf, that perhaps that infirmity was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him for his ſalvation, and was for the greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Soul, than health was; and therefore returning to the Sepulchre of the Saint, he prayed, that what ſhould moſt conduce to his ſalvation, whether ſickneſs or health, that <hi>Thomas</hi> would obtain it for him of the Lord. Whereupon his infirmity returned again upon him. And it was very friendly done of him, to impute the return of his diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to the Saints foreſight of the danger of his continuing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:52080:121"/>
in perfect health. Some there were alſo, whom S. <hi>Thomas</hi> would not cure, in civility to other Saints, (though you may be ſure he could have done it himſelf.) So <hi>Capgrave</hi> tells us, that a Clerk,<note place="margin">Capgr. vit. S. Cuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert. fol. <hi>78.</hi>
                        </note> having been troubled with vomiting, and a Bloody Flux, and a pain in his Eyes, that he was almoſt blind; this Man <hi>Fifteen</hi> Days together had implored the Martyrs help at <hi>Canterbury:</hi> To whom <hi>Thomas</hi> at laſt appeared; and bid him riſe quickly, and go to <hi>Durham</hi> to S. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> and by his merits he ſhould obtain mercy and health. For (ſaid he) I will have my languiſhing Patients and Servants go to him for Cure, and his come to me; and the firſt day he came thither he was cured. It's very obſervable, that this Clerk had ſerved <hi>Thomas</hi> before his exile, and ſo could leſs take it ill, to be ſent on his errand ſo long a journey.

her ſelf, and then ſuddenly leapt into the Fire and was burnt. Upon this <hi>plain Song,</hi> it's very pleaſant to obſerve what <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> the Makers of the <hi>Roman Breviaries</hi> have run.</p>
                     <p>They have told us of the Noble Race ſhe came of; of her chaſtity and humility in her younger Years; her Faſtings, Prayers and Almes; her Examination before the Heathen <hi>Prefect</hi> with his Queſtions, and her Anſwers, which you may ſee in <hi>Bollandus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Loc. citat.</note> who cites a great many old <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viaries:</hi> but the <hi>Breviary</hi> of <hi>

For Reliques, none can be more proper than her Teeth, and the parts about her Mouth; and here they are well furniſhed in abundance of places. (though the Saint li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo long ago.) At <hi>Rome,</hi> beſides her Head and Arm, one Church has part of her Jaw, and <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi> Churches I know not how many of her Teeth. At <hi>Volaterrae</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truria,</hi> there is preſerved her Mouth, part of her Jaw, and one of her Teeth. At <hi>Bononia,</hi> in <hi>ſeveral Churches</hi> they have her Teeth, and in <hi>one</hi> her Lower Jaw, which is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly venerated on the 9th. of <hi>February,</hi> by the <hi>Legate</hi> or <hi>Vice-Legate.</hi> At <hi>Antwerp</hi> they ſhow a part of her Jaw, by which frequent Miracles are wrought. At <hi>Mechlin</hi> they have part of a Tooth, and at ſeveral places in <hi>Flanders</hi> whole ones: At <hi>two</hi> places in <hi>Artois</hi> a remarkable portion of her Lower Jaw. At <hi>Colen,</hi> one Monaſtery has <hi>four</hi> of her Teeth, another has a Rib, and a Tooth, and Shoulder-blade; the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> her Jaw, S. <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Church a Tooth, and S. <hi>Albans</hi> in the ſame City her Lower Jaw. At <hi>Lisbon</hi> in the Church of S. <hi>Roch,</hi> one of her Teeth, and other Reliques of her.

                     <p>HE that had a mind to diſpute about the truth of thoſe Miracles, which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> has told us were wrought by S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> in his Life; might think ſome of them juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liable to be queſtioned; as that which he tells us of his being beaten by the <hi>Devil,</hi> till the greatneſs of the pain took away both all his motion and ſpeech, and that he was ſo cruelly handled, that he was at one time juſt a dying: and that other ſtory, how when he was going into a Ship, he complained to his Companions of a grievous ſtink, and preſently one poſſeſſed with a Devil, cryed out; whereby they gathered, that he perceived the Devil by his ſmell: (as <hi>Bollandus</hi> in his notes upon the place, ſays, S. <hi>Pachomius</hi> knew by the ſtench the preſence of an Heretick.) But my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is not to detract from the Saint, or to leſſen his due eſteem: Only one thing I obſerve, that he ſeems in his life-time to have had a more than ordinary care, to prevent all that after-veneration of his Reliques, which is now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:52080:126"/>
in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which we know both gives life to their Devotions, and raiſes expectation of his help in thoſe that apply themſelves to him for relief in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes. For the forenamed Father tells us, that he gave a ſtrict charge to thoſe that attended him when he dyed, <hi>that they ſhould not carry his Body into Egypt, leſt they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in their Houſes</hi>

                        </note>, which he explains a little before, <hi>that they did not commit the Body to the Earth, but wrapped it in Linnings, and putting it in a Bed, kept it in their Houſes, thinking thus to honour the Dead; (which is neither lawful nor pious) this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>he had blamed, and dehorted from the uſage of it.</hi> (and no doubt he would have blamed the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> cuſtomes as well as the old <hi>Egyptian;</hi> for why is it worſe to keep thoſe Remains in <hi>Beds</hi> above ground, than to place them upon <hi>Altars,</hi> or keep them in <hi>Boxes?) Bury therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>my Body, and cover it with Earth, and obſerve this charge that no man but you alone know the place of my burial: which they did,</hi> ſays Athanaſius, <hi>and no man hitherto, ſave thoſe two Perſons that miniſtred about him, knows where he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</hi> But the <hi>Roman Trade</hi> cannot be driven with this <hi>Secrecy of Interment,</hi> many a good Market would thus have been ſpoiled: Digged therefore he muſt be out of his Grave, and if the <hi>Monks</hi> be ſo ſullen, as not to diſcover where the place is, <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> will not fail to do it; and though it was near 200 Years before a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was made of it, yet <hi>Colen</hi> that got the <hi>three</hi> Kings, hath got too S. <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s Beard; and we are told of a wonderful tranſlation of his Body into <hi>France,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves relating:<note n="*" place="margin">In Hiſtor.

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:52080:127"/>
to Hell, and one of them caſting a Halter about his Neck, was ready to ſtrangle him: In this ſtrait S. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Guardian of the place, appeared, and chid, and drove away the Devils; commanded him to go his Journey to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and after that, in requital of his kindneſs, to carry his Reliques away, out of the <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> into the <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts of the World; becauſe there <hi>Christ</hi> would have him to be more highly venerated in time to come; all which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and begging the Body of S. <hi>Anthony</hi> of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, brought him from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> into <hi>France</hi> (though how his Body was brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> we are yet to learn.) But we are not to think that his whole Body was brought thence by <hi>Joceline;</hi> for in the Year 1231. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> from the ſame place brought part of his Arm to <hi>Bruges:</hi> At <hi>Colen</hi> (as was ſaid before) they ſhow S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s Beard, and a remarkable part of his Hand: they have ſome part of him at <hi>Tourney,</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> have two of his Reliques at <hi>Antwerp.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> one of his Churches is famous for his Sack-cloth, and ſome others for pieces of his Garment of Palmes, artificially weaved, which S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> wore on high Days, and ſome ſay belonged before to <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Hermit:</hi> but the moſt part of that famous Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are told, is preſerved and ſhown at <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

                        </note> we are told, from <hi>Arianiſm</hi> to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> by <hi>Alcimus Avitus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> in his Fathers Life-time. After his Death, he and <hi>Godomarus</hi> his Brother reigned over the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians.</hi> He had one Son by the Daughter of K. <hi>Theodoric,</hi> called <hi>Sigericus,</hi> but ſhe dying, he married a ſecond Wife; who, upon a great falling out with this Son, perſwaded <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund,</hi> that <hi>Sigericus</hi> ſought to poſſeſs his Kingdome, and without making him away he could not be ſecure; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon one Day commanding him to lye down and ſleep when he was drunk, he cauſed him to be ſtrangled; for which fact he afterwards was extreamly penitent: But the Divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance preſently followed him. For K. <hi>Clodomerus</hi> making War againſt him and <hi>Godomarus,</hi> they were overcome by him, and <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> with his Wife and Children being taken Priſoners, he together with them was ſlain, and his Body thrown into a Pit. This Death of his, which was a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation of his former crime, can ſcarce, one would think, amount to Martyrdome. But now, ſo acceptable was his repentance, that his Body being taken up out of the Pit, and buried in the Monaſtery of <hi>Agaunum,</hi> it was preſently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for working Miracles. <q>For now, ſays <hi>Gregory,</hi> if thoſe that are afflicted with Agues,<note place="margin">Greg.

                           <hi>Tuncque viſibiliter multis apparuit, quia bonus &amp; malus Angelus, &amp;c.</hi> (ſpeaking of the terrible Plague at <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Ticinum.</hi>) "Then it appeared viſibly to many, for a <hi>good</hi> and a <hi>bad Angel</hi> by Night went through the City, and by the command of the <hi>good Angel,</hi> the <hi>bad,</hi> who ſeemed to carry a Hunting ſtaff in his hand, as often as he ſmote with his Staff the Door of any Houſe, ſo many People dyed out of that Houſe, the Day following. Then it was ſaid by <hi>Revelation</hi> to a certain Perſon, that this Plague would not ceaſe, till the Altar of S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was placed in the Church of S. <hi>Peter ad Vincula;</hi> which being done, and the Reliques of S. <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> preſently upon the placing the Altar in the ſaid Church, the Plague ceaſed. <hi>Baronius</hi> adds, that the Altar it ſelf remains yet entire, as alſo the Image of the ſaid holy Martyr in Moſaick work. And from hence this piece of Religion is propagated to Poſterity, that in time of the Plague, by way of vow, the Image of the ſaid S. <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> is wont to be painted in divers places, and Altars to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to his memory, yea and Churches to be built.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are alſo farther informed by <hi>Bollandus (ad Januar.</hi> 20. <hi>in vit. S. Sebaſt.)</hi> what rare vows were made to him by thoſe of <hi>Milan,</hi> in a great Plague, <hi>An.</hi> 1575. They choſe him
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:52080:131"/>
for an eſpecial Saint to implore, not only becauſe he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred like benefits heretofore in other places; but chiefly becauſe his Mother was of <hi>Milan,</hi> and there alſo he was edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; and they vowed, if he would ſuccour them, to build a new Church in Honour of this Martyr, and ſettle a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for daily offices to be performed in it; to celebrate his Annual feaſt, with a Faſt the Day before; to bring ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oblations to his Church yearly, on the Day of this vow, <hi>(viz.</hi> on the <hi>Ides of October)</hi> and alſo on the Day of his Feaſt: to offer a precious Veſſel, to be a decent recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle for the Martyrs bones; and ſeveral other things of like nature, which you may be ſure were ſo obliging to him, that they could not fail of the deſired ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Neither does the Church want his Reliques, or <hi>they</hi> their miraculous effects; for though he lived ſo long ago (<hi>viz. An.</hi> 287.) that hinders not, but that in ſeveral Countreys and Cities, they have got remarkable portions of his Body; nay, more than one of thoſe very Arrows with which he was transfixed at his Martyrdom, are ſhown at this day. We are told, that in a Church of <hi>Capua,</hi> this Saints Reliques ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Water</hi> (as we heard before S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s did <hi>Wine</hi>) which is preſerved for the infirm, &amp; is ſo often called for, that they are fain thus to Conſecrate it, more than once a Year: at <hi>Ebersberg</hi> in <hi>Bavaria</hi> they have the Top of his Scull, which is venerated with great Religion all over <hi>Germany,</hi> and is a certain amulet againſt the Peſtilence; it being ſo included in Silver, that People may drink out of it, and in it Arrows are Conſecrated, which are great preſervatives againſt the Plague.</p>

                  <head>To St. <hi>Marguerite</hi> for Women with Child.</head>
                  <p>THere is a famous Legend of this Saint in the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Sarisbury Breviaries.</hi> (on the 26. of <hi>July.</hi>) In which theſe paſſages are remarkable. She deſired of God, that ſhe might have a conflict face to face with the Devil, that hitherto had been her ſecret and hidden enemy. Then the Devil appeared in the terrible ſhape of a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and ſwallowed her up: but ſhe preſently arming her ſelf with the ſign of the Croſs, the <hi>Dragon</hi> burſt aſunder, and the <hi>Virgin</hi> came unhurt out of his Belly. Afterwards ſhe ſaw another Devil, like a black man ſitting, whom ſhe catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Hair, threw him to the ground, and put her right Foot upon the Crown of his Head, and bid him tell
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52080:134"/>
her what he was. The Devil ſaid, lift up your Foot from my Crown, that I may ſpeak: Then he told her, that he was one of thoſe Spirits which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhut up in a brazen Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> coming, and thinking to have found Gold in it, broke it, and ſo we flew away. She alſo made him confeſs his arts of fraud and wickedneſs, and why he ſo miſerably tempted the Chriſtians; <hi>Et pedem virgo ſuble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans, mox velut fumus evanuit,</hi> and lifting up her Foot, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the Devil vaniſhed like ſmoak. [This was a notable trick of S. <hi>Marguerite,</hi> thus by putting the Devil to pain, to make him confeſs the Secrets of his own Trade and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueries; but S. <hi>Bernard</hi> made a worſe fool of him, and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly over-reached the Devil, to the diſcovery of a ſecret which concerned Mens ſalvation, and ſuch a Secret, as no good Angel ever told any Man, out of his own pure good will, the like. For thus I find it in a Rubrick of the <hi>Salisbury</hi> Hours. (<hi>fol.</hi> 123.) <hi>Whan Saint Bernard was in his Prayers, the Dyuell ſaid unto him; I know that there be certeyn Verſes in the Sawter, who that ſay them dayly ſhall not periſh, and he ſhall have knowledge of the day that he ſhall dye. But the Fende wolde not ſhowe them to S. Bernard: Than ſaid S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, I ſhall ſay dayly the hole Sawter. The Fende conſideringe that S. Bernard ſhall do ſo moche profyte and goode labor; ſo he ſhewed him thys Verſes.</hi> The Verſes are there ſet down, which begin thus, <hi>O bone Jeſu. Illumina oculos meos, &amp;c.</hi> Before every Verſe, as if it was intended for a charm, is ſet commonly, a hard name of <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew;</hi> as, <hi>O Adonai. Locutus ſum, &amp;c. O Heloy. Periit fuga à me &amp;c.</hi> And ſo before others, <hi>O Emanuel, O Agyos, O Raby, O Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton:</hi> and there alſo, among the reſt of the precious Devotions, (which were all taught him I ſuppoſe by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, for I find no diſtinction mentioned) is that unintelligible and nonſenſical Prayer, (which was mentioned at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Book) <hi>Peto Domine Jeſu, &amp;c.</hi>] When ſhe came to dye, ſhe prayed of God, that whoſoever writ, read or heard of her paſſion, might obtain pardon of his ſins, and whoſoever would build a Church to her honour, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:52080:134"/>
miniſter Candles out of his juſt labour for her ſervice, might have whatſoever he asked that belonged to his ſalvation: and in a more eſpecial manner <hi>(ſignanter)</hi> ſhe prayed for <hi>Women in Labour,</hi> that when they invoked her <hi>Patronage,</hi> they might have a ſpeedy <hi>Delivery,</hi> and eſcape the <hi>Danger,</hi> and that the Infant might be born without any defect of its Members. When ſhe had done praying, there was a great Thunder, and a <hi>Dove</hi> came from Heaven, ſaying, Bleſſed art thou <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Spouſe of Chriſt, behold, thy Petitions are granted thee by Chriſt, come into the reſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Countrey.</p>
                  <p>If theſe Requeſts and Anſwer can be ſuppoſed to be true, <hi>Saint Marguerite,</hi> for my Money; I ſee no need of any other Saint to pray to: and indeed I muſt commend the wiſdome of the Later <hi>Popes</hi> in leaving all this out of the <hi>preſent Breviaries;</hi> for this one ſtory would elſe have been enough to have ſpoiled the Market of the other Saints.</p>
                  <p>If any one have a mind to ſee this at large, and much more, let him conſult her Life, written in <hi>French</hi> Verſes, at the end of the <hi>Office of the Bl.

To which alſo the Women with Child are beholden, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them with a Prayer to her, though the Publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Church are very ſparing herein, being willing, I ſuppoſe, that the Bl.

The Prayer is this which follows, which I will not trouble my ſelf to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate into <hi>Engliſh Meeter,</hi> becauſe ſo many now a-days un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>There is one thing I muſt farther remark, which we meet with not only in this ſtory of S. <hi>Marguerite,</hi> but in <hi>Twenty</hi> other Lives of the Saints beſide: <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Admirable Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> they made to God before they dyed, together with the <hi>promiſes</hi> and <hi>priviledges</hi> they obtained in anſwer to their requeſts. God was very free, you will ſay, in a <hi>grant</hi> he made to S. <hi>Oringa;</hi> when he communicated to her one of his own properties,<note place="margin">Bolland. ad <hi>10</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuar. pag. <hi>651.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>viz. The knowing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thoughts,</hi> as a reward of her modeſty and chaſtneſs, and this too without her ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>(that we read of)</hi> For, we are told, that God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to her, that becauſe ſhe had never caſt her eyes upon the face of any man, ſhe ſhould <hi>(for the future.)</hi> be able to ſee into the inmoſt ſecrets of the heart of any Man whoſe face ſhe would look upon. But commonly the <hi>Priviledges</hi> they boaſt of given to the Saints, were in anſwer to their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; though moſt of them are ſuch, as are no ways becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:52080:135"/>
any Saint to <hi>ask,</hi> nor God to <hi>grant.</hi> To inſtance in a few here: (paſſing over many that have been named al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and others which we may have occaſion to mention afterwards.) We are told of <hi>four</hi> Petitions that S. <hi>Maidoc</hi> made to God, which according to the plain ſence of the words, expreſs either little Piety or Charity, but all of them, a great regard that he had to himſelf: and yet theſe Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſaid to be made,<note place="margin">Colganus vit. S. Maidoc. <hi>31</hi> Jan.</note> after that he had faſted <hi>Forty</hi> Days and Nights, without taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any food.</p>
                  <p>The 1. Petition was, <hi>That whoſoever of the Kingly race of the</hi> Lagenienſes, <hi>eſpecially of the Seed of Brandubius, ſhould ſit in the Seat of Maidoc, and dye in it, might not be with him in Heaven.</hi> This ſitting in the Seat of <hi>Maidoc, Colganus</hi> explains, by violent ſeiſing upon the poſſeſſions of his Church at <hi>Fearna,</hi> and holding them in poſſeſſion without repentance to his death; he prays that ſuch a one might not be ſaved: which is either a very fooliſh Prayer, or very uncharitable. To pray that a Sacrilegious Perſon, dying in impenitency, may not come to Heaven, is like praying that a ſtone may not fly upward into the Ayre: the weight of ſuch a ones ſins will depreſs him, without any other hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to keep him down: but if the Prayer refers to ſuch a ſevere puniſhment of his crime, that he may never have the grace to repent, and be ſaved; this is not becoming any Chriſtian to deſire towards his greateſt enemies; much leſs fit for this Saint to wiſh it, towards the race of this <hi>King,</hi> who (as his Life tells us) was his mighty <hi>Benefactour,</hi> and had beſtowed upon him that Land, whereon he built his <hi>Monaſtery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 2d. Petition breaths the ſame fiery ſpirit; <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of his Monks ſhould deny him, and prove a fugitive from him, ſuch a one, in like manner, might not be with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> The 3d. Requeſt was; <hi>That Hell might not impriſon thoſe after the Day of Judgment, who ſhould be buried in his Church-yard.</hi> This, ſays <hi>Colganus,</hi> is to be underſtood of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> devoutly deſiring to be buried there: but, by
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:52080:136"/>
his favour, the words are ſo general, that I cannot ſee, but that an <hi>Heretick</hi> may have as much benefit by this grant as any other Perſon; eſpecially ſince the rule of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this caſe is, that <hi>Favores ſunt ampliandi, Favours are to be underſtood in the largest ſence;</hi> and it's to be hoped, that S. <hi>Maidoc,</hi> if he had any foreſight in him, took care before he dyed, to Conſecrate a good large burying place; ſince, without doubt, if this was a known grant, there was like to be great crowding hither from all parts, and People would not be more careful, in their laſt Will and Teſtament, to commend their Souls into God's hands, than to commit their Bodies to be buried in this ſacred ground: Only I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one good help in this caſe; that the ſame priviledge, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Colgan. vit. S. Kieran. <hi>5.</hi> Mart. Num. <hi>38.</hi>
                     </note> was granted to S. <hi>Kieran,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Iriſh</hi> Saint; whoſe Church-yard, I ſuppoſe, had as much holineſs and vertue in it, as this of S. <hi>Maidoc</hi>'s had, and ſo might have as much cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>The 4. Petition was, <hi>That he might every day deliver one Soul out of Purgatory, until the Day of Judgment.</hi> This was a pretty requeſt for a Saint to ask, that he himſelf might do it; and argues that he had no mean opinion of his own merits, but thought that he was furniſht with a full ſtock and treaſury of them, that Souls might ſpend upon them thus daily, even till the laſt day: S. <hi>Kieran</hi> was a little more modeſt in another requeſt that he made<note n="*" place="margin">Colganus, ibid.</note>, (becauſe the favour depended upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and was not abſolute, as this was) viz. <hi>That whoſoever honoured the Feſtival of his Birth-day, might be rich in this World, and obtain reſt in the World to come.</hi> But who can believe, that God was as <hi>free</hi> in <hi>his Grants,</hi> as theſe Saints were <hi>fooliſh</hi> in <hi>their asking?</hi> I may then believe, that all the <hi>Iriſh Devoto's</hi> to this laſt Saint were <hi>ſaved,</hi> when I can be perſwaded that they were all <hi>rich;</hi> but till then, the Defender of theſe ridiculous ſtories, muſt not think that he has made them good, when he has told a great many others like them. It may not be amiſs however to

relate ſome of thoſe ſpecial Priviledges,<note place="margin">Colgan. in notis ad vit. Maidoc. ad num. <hi>33, 34.</hi>
                     </note> that we may a little better underſtand to what heights of folly ſuperſtition may advance. We are told then, that <hi>Gregory Turonenſis</hi> mentions <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Grant to S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> that every <hi>Friday</hi> he ſhould deliver one Soul out of Purgatory pains. The <hi>Ciſterſians</hi> boaſt, that it was granted by the Interceſſion of the <hi>Bl. Virgin,</hi> that the Devil ſhould have no power over any one, who at his death was cloathed in their habit: and we are informed, that it had like to have coſt a Monk of that Order very dear,<note place="margin">Bibliothec. Patrum Ciſtercienſ. p. <hi>171.</hi>
                     </note> who by the indiſcretion of his Attendants, who did not conſider ſufficiently <hi>Monaſtici habitus Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, the Sacrament of his Habit,</hi> had pull'd off his <hi>Cowl,</hi> to give him ſome relief in the heats of his Feaver, and ſo he dyed unhabited: who though he was conducted very civilly by good Angels, to the Gates of Paradiſe, yet the Keepers that ſtood there, refuſed to give him any entrance; no not though his conducting Angels urged much his good Life and ſtrict Devotion, yet all this would not do; for it was anſwered, that by an Eternal Law it was eſtabliſhed, that no <hi>Monk</hi> ſhould enter in at thoſe Gates without his <hi>Hood;</hi> and ſo the Gates being ſhut upon him, he ſtood trembling without, expecting every moment to receive the ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of damnation; Onely Chriſt the Judge was ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, that he reſtored him to life again, for ſo long a time, till he repenting of this neglect, might be habited in his <hi>Cowl,</hi> and ſo be fit without impediment to enter into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">To inſinuate the better, how ſafe a Man is, and ſecure of going to Heaven, when he is <hi>habited aright;</hi> they bring stories, to perſwade people, that the Devil watches, as a Cat does for a Mouſe, to find any one throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his habit, that he may have then a prey of him.

                  <p>This priviledge was approved and confirmed by ſeveral Popes. <hi>John</hi> XXII. in his Bull from <hi>Lyons, March</hi> 3. and in the 6th.

Know therefore that I admit thy Petition; but I will have thee to go to my <hi>Vicar,</hi> who has the power of binding and looſing in Heaven and Earth, and require this Indulgence of him in my Name. On the morrow after S. <hi>Francis</hi> went to the <hi>Pope,</hi> laid open before him <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mandate, intreating him, that <hi>what</hi> pleaſed Chriſt,<note place="margin">Lect. <hi>6.</hi> in Feſt. conſecr. S. Maria de Angelis.</note> whoſe place on Earth he held, and whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he repreſented, that that might not diſpleaſe him. The <hi>Pope</hi> at firſt did not think his requeſt reaſonable, becauſe it was altogether free, that is, without any oblations; it was the greateſt requeſt, and alſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perpetual. He ſaid, that it was requiſite, that he who would obtain pardon of his ſins, ſhould ſome ways deſerve it; and the <hi>Pope</hi> denyed that ever the <hi>Roman Court</hi> was wont to grant ſuch an Indulgence: The Cardinals alſo that were preſent, oppoſed the grant; ſaying, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it would be, that the Indulgences of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> and of the Holy Apoſtles, S. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> would be neglected. But the <hi>Pope</hi> at length underſtanding, that it was the Divine pleaſure it ſhould be ſo, he granted to S. <hi>Francis</hi> a plenary and free and perpetual Indulgence; but it was to take place only on one natural day of every year, that is, from, the <hi>Veſpers</hi> of the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> to the <hi>Veſpers</hi> of the next day, which was the <hi>Anniverſary day</hi> of the ſaid Churches <hi>conſecration.</hi>

                  <p>By this one Revelation to S. <hi>Francis,</hi> here are ſo many doubtful Points determined, (concerning Indulgences, the Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> as Vicar of Chriſt, the neceſſity of private confeſſions to the Prieſts, the interceſſion of the Bl. Virgin) that may well give us <hi>Proteſtants</hi> juſt cauſe of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had a greater hand in this grant, than <hi>Christ</hi> had. As for thoſe of this Church, who are bound to believe the truth of that, which has been confirmed by 15. <hi>Popes</hi> (and which one of the later of them,<note place="margin">Martyr.

to, that in a Year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> when he ſuſpended all <hi>other Indulgences,</hi> this was declared by his Letters, to be excepted and left untouched) I can only pitty the wretched temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the common people eſpecially are perpetually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to, by ſuch grants, of laying as much ſtreſs upon the keeping of a day, viſiting an Altar, or a Church, dying in ſuch a Habit, and being buried in ſuch a place, to procure the pardon of their ſins, and to promote their Salvation, as upon inward moral goodneſs, and purity of heart and life. In the former caſes, Miracles and Revelations are rung in their Ears, to give a mighty reputation to thoſe little and eaſie obſervances; and the defects of the Later are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſupplied by the uſe of the other, as the imperfection of Attrition by the Sacraments of the Church: but when were they told, that a balking of theſe uſages, would not prove dangerous to a perſon otherwiſe ſtudious of piety? No, no; the contrary is the buſineſs of this Church; amidſt a great looſneſs of manners, which they connive at and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, they furniſh the People with frightful ſtories, to oblige them to all the exactneſs and care imaginable, about poſtures and habits, and trifling rules of Orders. Here now, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert did but happen in the hot Summer time, to ſleep in a poſture not modeſt enough (though no body ſaw it till afterwards) and the Devil,<note place="margin">Caeſarius Dialog. diſtinc. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>33.</hi>

Beſides too, there is this affinity betwixt the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> that they are each of them a great <hi>Abyſs;</hi> and it is ſo common and Proverbial to expreſs all dangers by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> that it was great pitty, that he who had ſuch great command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>one,</hi> ſhould have no ſtroke in matters that related to the <hi>other.</hi> Paſſing therefore over other things which the <hi>Breviary</hi> mentions, (as his miraculous Election to be Biſhop of <hi>Myrea,</hi> not by the intervening of <hi>Lots,</hi> as in the choice of <hi>Matthias,</hi> but by a <hi>voice from Heaven,</hi> bidding them make him Biſhop, who firſt entered the Church next Morning, telling them his Name ſhould be <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which he firſt did, as if ſent by God) Let's only ſee, whence his fame aroſe for a Deliverer in diſtreſſes at Sea.

Barbara, ſuccour a miſerable wretch, and one dying in his ſins, which thing thou art now able to perform by thy Spouſe: Let that be done by thy Prayers in me, which was of old promiſed by Heaven to thee, as thou waſt a dying for Christ: Let thy Spouſe be mindful of thy roſie and Virgin blood, let him remember thy chast and Virgin love, that my Soul may not go out of my Body, till it be purged by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confeſſion, and fore-armed with the ſaving Viaticum.</hi>

                  <p>This is affirmed by many Authors. <hi>Guillelmus Pepin</hi>

The Original of this Devotion ſeems to be this: A certain <hi>Franciſcan Novice,</hi> throwing off his Habit, ran away from the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, (in which the Saint lived) and ſtole away with him a Pſalm Book, written with S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s own hand, and explained with Marginal notes, which S. <hi>Anthony</hi> often uſed, when he privately expounded the Scriptures to the Friers. As ſoon as <hi>Anthony</hi> perceived his Book to be ſtollen, he falling down on his Knees earneſtly prayed God, that he would reſtore the Book to him again. In the mean time the Apoſtate Thief having his Book with him, as he prepared to ſwim over the River, met the Devil; who with a drawn Sword in his hand, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him immediately to go back again, and reſtore to S. <hi>Anthony</hi> the Book he had ſtollen from him; threatning to kill him, unleſs he did ſo: The Devil required this with ſo terrible an aſpect, that the Thief being aſtoniſhed, preſently returns to the Monaſtery, reſtores to the Saint
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52080:149"/>
his Book, &amp; continued in a religious courſe of life ever after.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſee the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will never be at a loſs for ways to promote this their Superſtition. The moſt common Method we have heard of hitherto, has been <hi>Revelations</hi> and <hi>Voices,</hi> pretending gracious grants from God, to the merits of ſuch and ſuch Saints, that Perſons in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſtreſſes ſhould find deſired relief, when they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them: this ſeems to be a pretty plauſible incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to require only ſatisfaction in one doubt, how to be ſecured, that God ſpoke ſuch words; for if he did, who will not readily determine his practice, by the plain ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his heavenly will and pleaſure? But as for the occaſion here mentioned, there are, methinks, a great many diſcouraging circumſtances in the ſtory; ſo that the greater opinion a Man had of this Saint, the leſs expectation ſhould he, in all reaſon, have of recovering his loſſes by the choice of this Patron, if this be all that can be produced to aſſure him, that his addreſſes to him in this caſe ſhall not be unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. For, 1. Few Mens loſſes are of that importance, that S. <hi>Anthony's Pſalter</hi> was, eſpecially with his admirable <hi>Divinity</hi> noted in the Margin: And again, few Mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, if all be true that is told of him, could equalize his; and why then ſhould every one preſume that their Prayers ſhall be extraordinarily heard, becauſe his were? To which may be added this main doubt, that I believe that this is one of the firſt inſtances that can be given of the Devils threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and frighting any one into honeſty, and into Devotion; and, conſidering his intereſt, it's very likely to be the laſt of the kind: and for any one now to tell us (as <hi>Pepin</hi> did) that he has found the ſucceſs and benefit of ſuch addreſſes, would be only to ſet all the cunning Men, and all the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> a laughing (whoſe trade for diſcovering loſt goods, ſeems to be threatned, by ſetting up this Saint for a <hi>Patron</hi>) for they would be ready, I dare vouch for them, to forſwear their Art, if S. <hi>Anthony</hi> had ever helped ſo many to their loſt goods, as they will tell you they have done.</p>
                  <p>But it may be, it is not ſo much this fooliſh ſtory which
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52080:149"/>
                     <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> has pitched upon, (or at leaſt not this alone) as the mighty fame of S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the reputation he has got in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, partly as a powerful and prophetical Preacher, and partly as a worker of Miracles, that has invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to a ſtrange veneration of him; and then you may give them leave to chuſe what way to expreſs it in; and ſo many having been poſſeſſed before him of other Offices, this might fall to him of courſe.</p>
                  <p>That which I ſhall therefore do farther, ſhall be to give the <hi>Reader</hi> ſome account of the admirable things that are reported of him in his life; which <hi>Ribadeneira</hi> has given us more conciſely, and <hi>Surius</hi> more at large; and more lately (<hi>an.</hi> 1641.) <hi>Joh. de la Haye,</hi> (who has given us S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s works) has put that Life in <hi>Surius</hi> before them, with ſome <hi>additional Miracles</hi> after his <hi>Canonization,</hi> and has divided it, for the Readers greater caſe, into Chapters, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall cite all along in the following Diſcourſe.

                  <p>The firſt occaſion of his being noted for a Preacher (who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accounted an illiterate perſon,<note place="margin">Concerning S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Preaching.</note> and to have no farther skill than to ſay the Church-offices,<note place="margin">Ribaden. in vit.

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52080:150"/>
muſt: At the beginning of his Sermon he ſpoke to them ſimply and plainly;<note place="margin">Orſus eſt ſimpliciter ad eos dicere.</note> but in the progreſs of his diſcourſe, he uſed ſuch elegancy of words, ſuch heights of myſtical ſentences, that rapt all his Auditors into admiration, eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was beyond all their expectation.</p>
                  <p>And now the next thing we hear of him is, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives commiſſion from the <hi>Miniſter General</hi> to Preach abroad;<note place="margin">In vit. Antonii. cap. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> and he is ſo buſie in this new work, that he runs up and down from one City and Town to another: The <hi>Churches</hi> were not ſufficient wherein to ſpend his Zeal: but <hi>Camps</hi> and <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Fields</hi> are the Places where he chuſes to Preach in; which courſe of his the Jeſuite <hi>Lorinus</hi> would fain counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,<note place="margin">Lorinus in Act. <hi>2.</hi> v. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> from ſomething he fancies like it in the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> but the reſemblance is far greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and our <hi>Quakers;</hi> who are a reſtleſs Generation, troubleſome, and furious in their heats, of an ill-guided Zeal, and endeavouring to be popular by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of extraordinary humility.</p>
                  <p>He preached at <hi>Rome</hi> one time before the <hi>Pope</hi> ſo much to his content and wonder,<note place="margin">Vit. Ant. c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> that he called him <hi>Arcam Teſtamenti,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Teſtament:</hi> and well might he call him ſo, (ſays the Author of his Life) for he had the Scriptures ſo faſtned in his Memory, that he could from thence have wholly reſtored them, if all the Books of Scripture had been loſt. But whether the <hi>Pope</hi> had any great skill in Sermons or no, to be ſure S. <hi>Francis</hi> had: and we are told that when S. <hi>Anthony</hi> was preaching one time upon the paſſion of our Saviour,<note place="margin">Ibid. c. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> S. <hi>Francis,</hi> though he was far diſtant in another Countrey, yet he appeared to his Children after a wonderful manner in the Ayre, for he ſeemed to ſtretch out his Arms a-croſs, as it were approving <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Sermon, and ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the <hi>Friers</hi> ought to imitate, and bleſſing them, he made the ſign of the Croſs over them.</p>
                  <p>But we hear of a wonderful approbation of him for a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52080:150"/>
Preacher, which was given him by the Inhabitants of the <hi>Sea,</hi> more aſtoniſhing than this Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the <hi>Ayre.</hi>

Then the Holy man, after he had ſaluted them by the name of <hi>Brethren,</hi> (a complement he learnt from S. <hi>Francis</hi>) he rehearſed to them the benefits for which they were indebted to their Creator, what gratitude they owed Him, and what ſerviceable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they might perform towards him. (What pitty is it that this edifying Sermon ſhould be loſt, and ſince his skill was ſo great, that he did not leave a Treatiſe behind him upon this Subject, concerning <hi>The whole Duty of Fiſhes</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God?) When he had concluded his Sermon, the Fiſhes bended their heads, as if they asked his bleſſing, and went back into the Sea. And now it is no wonder to tell you, that the People were aſtoniſht at the Miracle, that the Heretiques that were preſent, were ſtruck as mute as Fiſhes, as to any farther oppoſition and contradiction; only they fell at his Feet, declaring their embracing the Orthodox Faith, and their Converſion. We are farther informed that a Prophetick Spirit accompanied his Preaching, of which they tell this ſtory.</p>

                  <p>It will be now, after all this, no ſtrange thing to be told, that all People were very deſirous to hear ſuch a Preacher, or to find him frequently engaged in this Work,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> when he is ſo much admired, that ſometimes <hi>Thirty Thouſand People,</hi> or more were preſent at one of his Sermons. When he preached a <hi>Lent</hi> courſe, the Church could not hold the Number of his Auditors, ſo that he was fain to hold forth in the open Fields. Thither from all Quarters People flock in crowds to hear him; They riſe before Day, and ſtrive which ſhall get firſt to the place, where the Sermon was to be: There you might ſee Souldiers and Noble Matrons, and ſuch as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before to lye long in Bed, running in the dark, and watchfully expecting the Preacher. The Tradeſmen would not open their Shops, or ſell their Wares, before his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was over. The good Women in devotion, cut off pieces of his Cloaths with their Sizzers, laying them up for Reliques, and he counted himſelf happy that could but touch the Hemm of his Garment. It was admirable to obſerve in this great Concourſe of People,<note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <hi>13.</hi> &amp; <hi>21.</hi>

The fervour of the Preacher was ſuch, that his ſpeech came from his Mouth, as from a hot Furnace; the effect was, that he wonderfully affected his Auditory, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into the very marrow of their Souls, raiſing in them much devotion and compunction, hatred and deteſtation of their Vices: ſo that People were heard to ſay one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with much ſighing; Ah miſerable wretch that I am I who never till now thought ſuch a thing to be a ſin, and if I had known it to be ſuch, would never have committed it:

                  <p>And now I cannot but fancy, after this huge noiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch an <hi>Angelical Preacher,</hi> it will be a very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gratification of the <hi>Reader,</hi> to acquaint him with S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s way of Preaching: That he may underſtand,

Some of which are theſe. <q>1. Becauſe the Apoſtles were ſent by <hi>pairs</hi> like <hi>Oxen:</hi> Act. 13. <hi>Separate to me Saul and Barnabas, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Becauſe an <hi>Oxe</hi> is a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>laborious animal.</hi> So S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>He laboured more abundantly than they all.</hi> 3. An Oxe <hi>spends little,</hi> though it <hi>labours much:</hi> and one of the Apoſtles ſayes, 1 Tim. 6. <hi>Having Food and Rayment, let us therewith be content:</hi> but ſome Prelates in our time are <hi>Palfreys,</hi> that ſpend much, and labour little. 4. Becauſe an Oxe has two Horns: and that which anſwers in the Apoſtles to theſe two Horns, is <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> Whence that Preacher is an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn,</hi> who has but one of theſe: With this Horn Preachers ought to blow, that is, with good Doctrine in preaching; which yet often profits little, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be accompanied with the other horn, that is, good life. Another reaſon is; becauſe there is nothing in an Oxe unprofitable; ſo neither in the life of the Apoſtles: Of the Hide of the Oxe ſhooes are made, and from the converſation of the Apoſtles an example is taken, which fortifies the affections, as a Shoe does the Feet; <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. <hi>How beautiful are thy goings in Shoes.</hi>

                     </note> The whole Diſcourſe is ſpent in comparing the Apoſtles to <hi>three</hi> things that ſound loud, and are heard afar off, viz. <hi>Thunder, Trumpets</hi> and <hi>Bells;</hi> and upon the laſt he is very large; and all that can be thought of about Bells, the Mettle they are made of, and whence it is digged, the Fire they are melted in, the Mold they are put into; The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of their ſound; The uſes they are put to; to raiſe from ſleep; to allay tempeſts; to quench fires; to cover fires, and give notice of Bed-time; to call People together; to give warning of death; to ſignifie the approach of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe are applyed with horrible ſtraining, and abſurdity to the Apoſtles preaching.</p>
                  <p>But it were well if this were the worſt in S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Sermons, that he talked fooliſhly concerning the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Saints;</hi> for I know not how he can be excuſed from this charge, in reference to <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Upon thoſe words, Luc. 11. <hi>If I by the finger of God caſt out Devils, &amp;c.</hi> He deſcants in this manner,<note place="margin">Serm.

The Finger of God notes the difference of his work. For the hand ſignifies work, and the fingers placed in the hand are the difference of works. But now becauſe the Lord either has wrought, or will work for the future with all his fingers; it is to be noted, that as there are five fingers, ſo there are five works of God. The firſt is called the <hi>Thumb,</hi> in which the ſtrength of the hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts: by vertue of this finger the Lord wrought in the Creation of the World, and the diſperſing of Men, in the time of the Deluge, in the working of Miracles in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Magicians</hi> ſaid, <hi>The finger of God is here,</hi>

Exod. 8. The 2d. finger is the <hi>fore-finger,</hi> called <hi>Index, ab indicando,</hi> from pointing, and to this wiſdome is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted: with this God wrought in the giving of the Law, when he wrote it with this finger in Tables of Stone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. The 3d. is called the <hi>middle-finger,</hi> and this is the finger of clemency and mercy, whereby God's revenge is deferred, and which joyns God with the Creature: with this Finger God wrought, when he drove out the Devil by it. Whence S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon <hi>Matthew</hi> ſays, <hi>With the finger of God,</hi> that is, by the Holy Ghoſt. For the <hi>Father</hi> is the Arm in which is power, the <hi>Son</hi> is the hand in which is induſtry; and as the hand works by the fingers, and the Arm by the hand, ſo the power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Son: Joh. 1. <hi>All things were made by him.</hi> Mark alſo the difference in the fingers, which ſignifies dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Graces, though it be the ſame ſpirit. The 4th. finger is the <hi>Ring-finger,</hi> that is, the promiſe of Glory: So, Luk. 15. <hi>Put a Ring upon his hand;</hi> i. e. on his Finger. With this finger he now works by his <hi>promiſe,</hi> and at the end of the World will work by <hi>beſtowing</hi> of Glory. The 5th. is the <hi>little</hi> or <hi>Ear-finger. (auricularis.)</hi> This is that, which makes the Ears tingle: 1 King. 3. <hi>Behold I do a work in Iſrael, which whoſoever hears, both his Ears ſhal tingle.</hi> This is the Finger of Judgment <hi>hereafter,</hi> and of threatning at the <hi>preſent.</hi> With this finger <hi>Chriſt stooping down, wrote on the ground,</hi> Joh. 8. But when he ſhall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to Judgment, he will write in every ones heart a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them: This is that <hi>Little-finger thicker than his Father's Loines,</hi> 3 King. 12. In the Loines of the back the vertue of generation does conſiſt, and it ſignifies the kindneſs beſtowed by God the Father upon ungrateful ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but the Judgment that is given to the Son ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all thoſe.</q>

                  <p>What <hi>Divinity</hi> they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church will call this, I know not, but one might expect ſure as good as this from every <hi>Kitchin;</hi> and if theſe be the admirable ſtrains of his Preaching, I think S. <hi>Anthony</hi> had better have kept to his

For I think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Man before him took ſuch <hi>starts</hi> from the Scripture to let looſe a number of fooliſh fancies, which he had not the diſcretion to reſtrain, even when they bordered upon Blaſphemy.</p>

                     <q>But here ariſe three doubts: 1. How ſins are called Scribes. 2. How they are ſaid to ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair. 3. How we ought to do according to what they bid us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. <hi>It's worth hearing how this rare Caſuiſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it.</hi> As for the firſt, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> anſwers, cap. 10.1. <hi>The writers have writ unrighteouſneſs, that they might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the poor in judgment.</hi> Alſo there are Books, and Letters, and Writings againſt a Man in the laſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.— Sins therefore may be called Phariſees, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they divide, but as they condemn; and alſo becauſe they inroll a Man into the Family of the Devil.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As for the 2d. Doubt: How they are ſaid to ſit in the Chair, it is plain enough. The <hi>mind of man</hi> may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Chair of Moſes,</hi> in which the divine Law ought to ſit.— <hi>The Soul of the just man is the Seat of Wiſdome:</hi> Or elſe we may ſay, that they ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, whilſt by ſin they kill the divine Law; Eſa. 14. <hi>I will ſit in the Mountain of the Teſtament,</hi> that is, in the height of the perfection of the Divine Law.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>As for the 3d. How we ought to do all that they bid us. That of the Gloſs, is to be noted. <hi>All things,</hi> viz. which are profitable to Salvation: for we are to do all ſuch things, but we muſt not do according to their works. For we muſt know that every vice commends its oppoſite ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: <hi>ex. gr. Anger</hi> commends Patience, Gluttony Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. Therefore though the works of vices are evil, <hi>(and ſo ought not to be done)</hi> yet they commend the contrary
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:52080:160"/>
vertues, as appears, becauſe every vice would cover it ſelf under the cloak of vertue, as appears in Pride. Thus therefore, <hi>Whatſoever they ſay unto you do, but do not after their works, &amp;c.</hi> Sin condemns it ſelf, and yet does not ceaſe to infeſt the Soul, and therefore it follows well, <hi>They bind heavy burdens, &amp;c.</hi>

Into the 1. Deſart, that is Heaven, a man ought to be led by the <hi>Spirit of wiſdom,</hi> by the contemplation of celeſtial things.

                  <p>I hope the Reader by this time is pretty well aſſured that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> was no Conjurer, as to making of Sermons: That whomſoever he took to imitate in his myſtical and moral expoſitions of Scripture, he was the dulleſt and the moſt nonſenſical certainly that ever appeared in this way. That the way it ſelf of his preaching was childiſh beyond meaſure, mere toying with the word of God; had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it to make any one a jot the <hi>wiſer,</hi> nor fitted to move any thing ſcarce within a man, ſave only his <hi>spleen:</hi> that it is an unpardonable impudence in the writers of his
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:52080:162"/>
Life, to cry him up, as if he was an Angel in the Pulpit, when there is not one page among all his Sermons worth any wiſe mans reading, and every line almoſt gives them the lie. That though there is no defence to be made for the fooliſh preaching of our own <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> at home, and the Papiſts may think they have a mighty advantage againſt us when they object it: yet this I will ſay, that there is not one of <hi>our men</hi> ſo ridiculous in Print, let them chuſe where they pleaſe, but may be play'd for any wager againſt <hi>their S. Anthony,</hi> and will come off better.</p>
                  <p>But it is more than time to proceed to the other Head, of <hi>his Miracles:</hi>

was ſet up in ſome haunted place, (for we heard before that S. <hi>Anthony</hi> did not always preach in Churches) and that the Devil was diſturbed in his uſual walk: only one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſpeaks it rather to be a fable, when it's ſaid, in the ſtory, that the fall of it neither hurt nor ſo much as frighted any body; for S. <hi>Anthony</hi> had forewarned his Auditors, that they ſhould not be terrified, if they ſhould chance to hear any noiſes; and it was an extraordinary ſpeech indeed, that could prevent, when this happened, the womens frights and fears.

One would wonder at the many ſpightful and <hi>Dog-tricks</hi> which, they tells us, the Devil ſerved many of their great Saints. The other S. <hi>Anthony</hi> the <hi>Hermit</hi> (as we heard before) was almoſt beaten to death by him. S. <hi>Benedict</hi> had a <hi>Bell</hi> which was tied to a cord,<note place="margin">Brev.

he drew him along by his Cowl, and threw him a great way into an entry; and when the Monk took up a ſtick to ſtrike him, he ſtood and laught at his blows. S. <hi>Ethelwold</hi> was ſeverely handled by him,<note place="margin">Ribadeneira vit. S. Ethelw. Aug. <hi>1.</hi>

Then the Devil threw the Pix at him, which had the <hi>Hoſts</hi> in it; after that ſpilt a horn of Wine upon him, then threw a pitcher of water at him and a piece of wood with a Croſs upon it; but when thus all night abuſing him he moved him not at all, he departed from him; only he leſt ſuch a ſtink behind him, as could ſcarce be endured by man: Another time, as he fate by his fire-ſide, the Devil gave him ſuch a box on the ear, that almoſt fell'd him flat to the ground. Another bout they had, when S. <hi>Godrick</hi> (ſuſpecting he was no man, though he appeared in that ſhape) catechized him, and asked him whether he believed in the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and bid him worſhip the Bl. Virgin: The Devil ſurlliy bid him not to trouble himſelf about his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and told him that he had nothing to do to inquire into it. Then <hi>Godrick</hi> took out his book which had the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Bl. <hi>Mary,</hi> and of S. <hi>John</hi> in it, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it haſtily to his mouth, bad him if he believed in God, to kiſs devoutly thoſe pictures: The Devil not being able to indure any longer, did, as it were, ſpit upon the book, and diſappeared mocking of him. He alſo another time abuſed him in the ſhape and habit of a Hermit, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:52080:163"/>
chouſed him of his bread and money;<note place="margin">Capgrav. ibid. p. <hi>162.</hi>
                     </note> and prayed him to touch his ulcerous body, for he hoped he ſhould have eaſe thereby: the Saint in great compaſſion touched his Body; which felt juſt like the body of a Gooſe with the Feathers off. But (though we are beholden much to him for that diſcovery, yet) this touch ſo inflamed him with obſcene temptations, that it had like to have coſt him the loſs of his Chaſtity. But nothing grieved the Saint more, than that he had beſtowed his gifts on the Devil, and he had carried them away with him; which coſt him many tears, and great penances. He alſo much wondered that he ſtood the ſprinkling of Holy Water, yea and kneeled down and prayed with him, and entred into the Church. But the Devils buſineſs was, not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long godly; for the next appearance to him (as he was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Apples) was as <hi>filthy,</hi> as this was <hi>devout;</hi>

                     </note> for he went away in a ſtink, ſhowing him his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriours, and ſomething elſe beſides, which was ſo horrid, that it made the good Man's hair all ſtand up on end, like Hogs briſtles. But the moſt terrible aſſault, was when the Saint lay in his Bed, and could not, through Age, raiſe himſelf up in it without help: then the Devil ſtood by him, and crying out, brandiſhed a flaming Weapon againſt him;<note place="margin">Ibid. f. <hi>164.</hi>

                  <p>But the Devil has been often paid home in his own Coin, and ſerved trick for trick. The forenamed S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> made him run into a corner,<note place="margin">Capgr. in vit. Barthol. f. <hi>33.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe apparent forgeries and Fables hitherto mentioned, concerning S. <hi>Anthonie</hi>'s preaching and miracles relating thereunto, muſt needs take away all credit from other ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries told of him, if nothing elſe did: for he that will go about to deceive me with his lies, in a matter where I can eaſily detect him, deſerves to be disbelieved in other things, where his cheats cannot ſo plainly be diſcovered, but yet is carrying on the ſame deſign.</p>
                  <p>Such are the ſtories of this Saint about <hi>Confeſſion.</hi> As when they tell us, that he uſed in his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to appear to perſons as they lay in their beds, and ſay to them; <hi>Ariſe Martin,</hi>

For the ſame man to perform ſeveral offices at the ſame time in diſtant places, is no eaſie matter to be credited; yet thus we are told, that S. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> preaching at <hi>Mompellier,</hi> after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun his Sermon,<note place="margin">Vit.

S. <hi>Antoninus</hi> in his Hiſtory relates this ſtory alſo;<note place="margin">

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:52080:166"/>
on the contrary <hi>advances God</hi> (as this does) if ſo be the Scripture in no other place oppoſes it, (as it does not.)</p>
                  <p>This I mention by the way to ſhow that there is no <hi>fooliſh fable</hi> told in that Church, though never ſo improbable, but they have <hi>Divines</hi> with as <hi>fooliſh reaſons</hi> ready to diſpute for it, and defend it. But whether S. <hi>Anthony</hi> could be in <hi>two places</hi> or not, at the <hi>ſame time;</hi> yet we are to believe that he was in <hi>two very far diſtant places,</hi> in <hi>leſs time</hi> than any would imagine. For when his Father, who dwelt at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> was clapt into Priſon with his whole Family, upon ſuſpicion of Murder,<note place="margin">Vit. Anton. cap. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe a Youth that was ſlain, was found buried in his Garden; the Spirit gave him notice of it, and in one Night he was carried from <hi>Padua</hi> (the place where he was) to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and appeared before the Judge the next Morning, deſiring him to let go thoſe innocent Perſons; which he refuſing, he then prayed to let the Body of the ſlain Youth be brought to him; which being granted, he commanded him to riſe up, and tell whether <hi>his Parents</hi> murdered him, or no: the dead Body hereupon aroſe, and ſaid, that they were all inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of his ſlaughter; and ſo they were releaſed, and the next Day he was brought back to <hi>Padua</hi> by the Miniſtry of an Angel. We are to ſuppoſe that this was a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, whoſe Miniſtry he uſed; but methinks, conſidering how ſcurvily the Devil had before uſed S. <hi>Anthony,</hi> it had been better if they had told us, that he ſadled the Devil for this Journey;<note place="margin">Vincentii Speculum lib. <hi>19.</hi> cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> as he was ſerved once by S. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidius.</hi> who having buſineſs with the <hi>Pope,</hi> got upon the Devils back, and made him carry him to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there attend at the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Gate, till he had diſpatched his affair; and then made him carry him back again to the place from whence he came. But the hardeſt thing to be believed, in the foregoing ſtory, is, that rather than the Parents of this Saint, ſhould ſuffer unjuſtly, (though it has been the fate of many as good Men before them, both as to their good Names and Lives) a dead body muſt be raiſed to life, to clear their Innocency, and to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the truth. The Writers of the Lives of the Saints, I obſerve, are very Liberal of Miracles in ſuch caſes; and he that can give credit to <hi>them,</hi> ſhall have my leave to do the ſame to <hi>this</hi> of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> We are told, that a poor Man complaing to S. <hi>Vedaſtus,</hi> that one had ſtollen a Sheep from him, and he could not find out the Thief: the Saint firſt took this courſe,<note place="margin">Bollandus ad <hi>6</hi> Febr. p. <hi>813.</hi>

S. <hi>Mel</hi> lying under a ſuſpicion, that he had too great familiarity with his Kinſwoman named <hi>Lupita,</hi>

                     </note> he cleared himſelf this admirable way before S. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick,</hi> by fiſhing and catching Salmons in the furrows of plowed ground: and ſhe removed all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies on her part, when ſhe took hot burning Coals into her Lap, and yet did not hereby ſinge her Cloathes. A Noble Matron of <hi>Sardinia,</hi> having brought forth a Child like a Blackmore, when ſhe and her Husband were both fair, was ſuſpected of Adultery with her Servant that was a <hi>black: Guillelmus</hi> a <hi>Speluncato,</hi> a famous Preacher there, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true Father thus.

                     </note> and the Blackmore, all to ſtand forth before the People; Then from the Pulpit he commanded the Child in the Name of Chriſt, that without any help it ſhould go to its true Pather; immediately hereupon the Infant, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe uncapable of walking<note n="*" place="bottom">As uncapable as a Child is of underſtanding, and ſpeaking at <hi>40</hi> days old, yet S. <hi>Amandus</hi> catechized one no older, and it pronounced clearly the word <hi>Amen,</hi> and was baptized by him. <hi>Bolland. ad 6 Febr. p. 856.</hi>

the Child being ſo wiſe at that Age, as to know his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But the worſt is, ſo free the Monks were of their wonders in former days, that we read of as great a Miracle as any of theſe, of which I can ſee no other end, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh a falſe perſwaſion into Mens minds, for it ſerved to clear no truth in Queſtion. It is that which <hi>Capgrave</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates concerning the Mother of S. <hi>Kentigern;</hi> who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Bl. Virgins</hi> fruitfulneſs without the knowledge of any Man,<note place="margin">Capgrave vit. S. Kentigern, f. <hi>208.</hi>
                     </note> raſhly prayed to God daily, to be like her both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and bringing forth: a while after ſhe was found with Child, and magnifying God, ſimply believed that her deſires were fulfilled; for ſhe often aſſerted, yea and ſwore, that ſhe knew not <hi>by whom,</hi> nor <hi>when,</hi> nor <hi>how</hi> ſhe became with Child: and the People of S. <hi>Kentigern</hi>'s Dioceſs to this day aſſert, that he was conceived and born of a Virgin. He calls them indeed <hi>Fools</hi> for ſaying ſo; but I think he was as great a <hi>Fool,</hi> for proclaiming the following wonder, which if true, might well confirm the People in their belief. He ſays then, that the <hi>King</hi> her Father coming to inquire of her, both by threats and fair words, who got her with child, ſhe again proteſted with an oath, that ſhe never had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of any Man. At which the King being offended, would have the <hi>Law</hi> in this caſe to paſs upon her; in which it was of old ordained in that Countrey, that a Maid committing fornication in her Fathers houſe, and proving with Child, ſhe ſhould be caſt head-long from the top of a Mountain, and he that corrupted her ſhould loſe his head: This Law he commanded to be executed upon her, (with a deſign I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe chiefly to find out him that had dared to corrupt the King's Daughter, which it might well be imagined ſhe would confeſs before ſhe dyed.) She was placed then on the brow of the Mountain called <hi>Dunpelder,</hi> and thrown headlong down from thence; (without confeſſing any thing.) She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the ground with a pleaſant eaſie ſliding, and not any Member of her Body was broken, or ſo much as hurt. The <hi>Pagans (Capgrave</hi> ſays) aſcribed this to Magick, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:52080:168"/>
therefore with the King's conſent put her into a little Veſſel made of Leather, and having brought her ſome Miles off from ſhore, they committed her alone to fortune and the Sea, for there were no Oars, or Men to help to guide it: but notwithſtanding this danger, ſhe did not miſcarry; for her Veſſel went faſter than if it had had the benefit of Sailes and Oars, and ſhe was brought ſafe into the Port. What could a Chriſtian think of this double Miracle, but that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of what was laid to her charge, that ſhe had neither fornicated, nor was forſworn? But then what becomes of the truth of what is ſo often ſaid and ſung in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (and owned by all Chriſtians) that the Mother of our Saviour only had this priviledge, and that ſhe was <hi>Virgo puerpera ſingularis?</hi> I am afraid it will prove a hard task to bring this off well. But to return to S. <hi>Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all theſe miraculous things that are told concerning him, who can doubt, but that his ſanctified breath might work ſuch a wonder, as we hear he wrought upon a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Novice;<note place="margin">Ribaden. ibid. p. <hi>149.</hi>
                     </note> who being frequently tempted by the Devil to forſake his Order, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it to the Saint, he only opened his mouth and blew into it, ſaying, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he was freed from all his temptations, and perſevered in the Religious courſe he had undertaken.

This moved ſuch a holy indignation in theſe Saints (though ſome may judge it exceeded its bounds) that they imprecated the Divine vengeance againſt the woman and her off-ſpring: The Child of this woman, as it was playing upon an high bank of the Sea, ſuddenly fell into it, where it was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up preſently and appeared no more. Upon this misfortune, the Mother comes crying and howling to S. <hi>Senanus</hi> (whoſe diſciples theſe two angry Saints were) complaining how upon their curſes her Child was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

ſons, as guilty of murder: and he commanded <hi>Libernus</hi> to go and ſtand upon a rock, placed in the neighbouring Sea, and there do his penance: As for <hi>Sedonius,</hi> he bad him go look for the drowned Child in the Sea, and not deſiſt his ſearch till he had found him and reſtored him to his Mother: They both of them obey this rigid ſentence of the holy Father. <hi>Sedonius</hi> in his queſt after the Child in the midſt of the Sea, finds it (after it had lain there twenty four hours) ſafe and ſound, playing in the waters and beating the waves with the palms of its hands, and ſo brought it to S. <hi>Senanus;</hi> who bad him go and fetch home <hi>Libernus</hi> from the rock, ſaying that he had found a very favourable judge; as indeed it proved, for the waters of the Sea that uſed to cover that rock at other times <hi>(by the riſing of the tide)</hi> did not dare to touch him, but kept off the length of his ſtaff round about him.</q>

                  <p>If this had been as current a Miracle in S. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s time, as it pretends to be publick, and to be a triumphant victory after a chalenge, and a ſet diſpute with a Heretick; I am apt to fancy, that <hi>Caeſarius</hi> who pickt up all miraculous reports about the time he lived, would have met with it, &amp; deliver'd it down to us in his Dialogues<note n="*" place="margin">This I think not improbable, becauſe he wrote his Dialogues ſo little a while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Anthony's death, for he tells us that he was writing them, an. <hi>1222.</hi> (and the Saint dyed <hi>1231.)

                  <p>The ſumme of all I have now ſaid put together, amounts to this.

                  <p>I have but one thing more to Remark, which muſt not be omitted, and then I have done with this Saint. That is, the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:52080:173"/>
prodigious Licence they of this Church take to entertain the People with ſtrange Miracles, in this of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, above all other Subjects. They have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed the belief of a Doctrine contrary to the reaſon and ſenſe of all Mankind, and it muſt be maintained in the ſame way that it was made. No mortal Man can invent any thing ſo extravagant and fooliſh, which they can pretend reaſon to boggle and ſtick at, who have once made <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> an Article of their Faith: I have no hopes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make them aſhamed in the leaſt, by what I ſhall now ſay; yet however it may be uſeful to others who have not inſlaved all their faculties, or committed themſelves blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to the conduct of their pretended unerring Guide, to know what Diet their faith lives upon, and what hard mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels it muſt ſwallow down without any chewing at all. It were endleſs to enumerate the wonders they produce in the lives of Saints, and in Sermons, to procure veneration in Mens minds to the Euchariſt; I ſhall content my ſelf with giving a few Inſtances of Miracles that they tell us, have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the <hi>preſence</hi> or <hi>celebration</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>We know there is a certain time in the Maſs, when they lift up the Hoſt, and ſhow it to the People, in order to their adoration of it.

               <p>EVery one that is acquainted with the <hi>Common Litanies</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, knows that they are ſtuft with the names of Saints, whom they deſire to pray for them; and are larger or ſhorter, according as more or fewer Saints are inſerted: and there being little or no difference beſides between the Older Litanies and the Later, I ſhall give the Reader one that was in uſe here in <hi>England,</hi> as I find it in a <hi>Pſalter</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi> 1503. Whereby he will underſtand what a pretty number of Saints (and ſome of them very odd and ſtrange ones) they invoked in thoſe days, and applied themſelves to in their Prayers. After the uſual invocation therefore of God and the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it goes on thus.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t obſequium ſervitutis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae rationabile facias.</note> 
                  <hi>That God would make their ſervice to him rational.</hi> This requeſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how abſurd their Devotions are, was a very needful one, and was for ſome while continued in their Litanies; (for I find it in one of them, among the Hours of <hi>Sarum,</hi> printed 1530. and alſo in a Litany in Queen <hi>Marie's Primer,</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1555.) but they perceiving that it was never likely to be heard, becauſe they were never likely to amend their follies to any purpoſe, they have ſince very wiſely omitted it, and it is left out of all the new Litanies.</p>
               <p>It would be alſo too tedious to examine the foregoing Catalogue of Saints names. <hi>Fides, Spes,</hi> and <hi>Charitas,</hi> which were mentioned together, you muſt believe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Martyrologie</hi> that they were <hi>Saints,</hi> and not the <hi>Graces</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> But I cannot ſo eaſily grant this of one, which juſt goes before them, <hi>viz.</hi> S. <hi>Sapientia;</hi> for I cannot meet with her in the <hi>Roman Martyrologie,</hi> nor in that of <hi>Ado,</hi> or of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuardus:</hi> only Mr. <hi>Creſſy,</hi> I find,

has put her among the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulan Virgins;</hi> but their names (as we heard before) are moſt of them known only by thoſe Revelations which he diſcards. It's well therefore if in this caſe there has not been ſuch a miſtake committed, as the ſorry Prieſt, according to the ſtory, was guilty of, who bad <hi>Sol in Cancro,</hi> which he found in Red Letters in his Almanack, for an <hi>Holiday:</hi> and there too you may find <hi>O Sapientia</hi> ſet down, nine days before <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> But that refers to no <hi>Saint,</hi> but to certain <hi>Antiphona</hi>'s, which are required to be uſed on thoſe days; the firſt of which begins with, <hi>O Sapientia quae ex ore Altiſſimi prodiiſti,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But if you ask me farther, what is the meaning of ſo vaſt a number of Saints put into this Litany? I can give no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anſwer than this, That they ſeem to have had the ſame fancy, which their old Homily admirably expreſſes thus.</p>

Yet the Sea with-drawing it ſelf, does twice a-day afford a paſſage to devout people to go to the Church of <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel.</q>

                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 3. <q>Now let us ſee how this place was dedicated by the Revelation of the Angel. After that <hi>Authbertus</hi> Biſhop of the ſaid place and beloved of God, had been twice admoniſhed in his Dream to build a Church to the honour of S. <hi>Michael</hi> on the height of that place; it happened that the <hi>Bull</hi> of a certain man was hid there for a time by a Thief: The Biſhop was warned a third time more ſharply, to build a Church in that place, where the <hi>Bull</hi> was ſecretly tied.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 4. <q>And when he deſired to be ſatisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the largeneſs and quantity of ground (for his build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) he received an anſwer in his dream, that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his building ſhould be that path which the <hi>Bull</hi> had worn in circuit with his feet, and he was commanded to ſee the Bull reſtored to his owner.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="415" facs="tcp:52080:215"/>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 5. <q>Then the Biſhop being aſſured of the Viſion, went to the foreſaid place, and cauſed it to be cleanſed and levelled. But in the middle of it, two Rocks ſtood out; which when they could not remove by the labour of many Workmen; a certain Man named <hi>Bayno,</hi> by a divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, came to the ſaid place with his <hi>Twelve</hi> Sons, and by the help of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> he removed the Rock, of ſo great magnitude, ſo that there ſeemed to be no weight there.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 6. <q>When the Biſhop doubted ſtill about the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fabrick, at Midnight there fell a Dew upon the top of the Mountain, but where the Foundations were to be placed, there it was altogether dry. And it was ſaid to the Biſhop, Go, and as thou ſeeſt it ſigned, lay the Foundations.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 7. <q>Then the Biſhop giving thanks to God, built the Fabrick on the top of the Mountain, round like a Vault, capable of holding, as is judged, a Hundred Men, after the faſhion of that in Mount <hi>Garganus.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 8. <q>After this, by the advice of Bl. <hi>Michael,</hi> Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers were ſent to Mount <hi>Garganus,</hi> to fetch thence To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens <hi>(pignora)</hi> of Bl. <hi>Michael;</hi> who being honourably received by the Biſhop and Abbot of the place, they humbly declared the cauſe of their coming.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Leſ.</hi> 9. <q>The things they came for were delivered to them: <hi>viz.</hi> part of a red Mantle, (or ſhort Cloak, <hi>palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oli)</hi> which Bl. <hi>Michael</hi> himſelf laid upon the Altar, which he built with his own hand; and alſo part of a Marble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, upon which he ſtood, whoſe foot-ſteps to this day remain in the ſaid place. Then the Biſhop <hi>Authbertus,</hi> honourably receiving the ſaid Gifts, finiſhed his work; and appointed the Offices of <hi>Twelve</hi> Clergy-men there; giving them <hi>two</hi> Villages out of his Biſhoprick, for to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee from this Legend, that when People are mad with ſuperſtition, any ſtory of a <hi>Cock</hi> and a <hi>Bull,</hi> will ſerve their turns to found a Feſtival upon, and to give occaſion
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:52080:216"/>
for the further Veneration of a Saint, or an Angel, though the circumſtances are never ſo improbable. This of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Rock is a pretty ſtretcher, and is more plainly told in the <hi>Feſtival,</hi> the Names only varied. <q>Alſo <hi>Michael</hi> appered to another Byſhop,<note place="margin">Feſtival de S. Michaele, f. <hi>144.</hi>
                           </note> and badde hym go to an hyll toppe unto the Mount of <hi>Gardell,</hi> and there as he founde a Bull teyed, he ſholde make a Chyrche in the worſhyp of God and Saynt <hi>Mychaell.</hi> Than were there two roches of ſtone on eyther ſide, that the werke myght not up. Than Saynt <hi>Mychaell</hi> appered to a Man that hyght <hi>Haymo,</hi> and badde hym go and put awaye the roche and drede no thynge. So this Man went thyder and ſette to his ſhoulders, and badde the roche goo utter in the name of God and Saynt <hi>Mychaell</hi> and ſo the hylles wente ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as moche as neded to the werke.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now that this work is thus wonderfully finiſhed, you may be ſure that S. <hi>Michael</hi> will not be wanting to give countenance and incouragement to his worſhip here, by his miraculous works. <hi>Jacobus de Voragine</hi> has recorded one fitly matched with thoſe that have gone before.<note place="margin">Voragine de S. Michaele.</note> 
                        <q>When a great Multitude were going to this Church (for twice a Day, as we were told, the Sea that encompaſſes the Mount gives the People a paſſage) it happened that a big-bellied Woman, and near her time, went along with them: And behold the Sea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a mighty force, and all the Company in a great fright fled to the ſhore again; onely the Woman with Child, not being able to fly, was overtaken by the Waves of the Sea: But <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Woman unhurt; ſo that ſhe brought forth her Child in the midſt of the Sea, <hi>(which was a fine lying in)</hi> and taking her Child in her Arms there gave it ſuck; and the Sea making her a way, ſhe came forth rejoycing with her Child.</q>

               <head>A Brief Concluſion concerning the Worſhipping of Angels.</head>
               <p>As the deſign of this Book is to acquaint the Reader with the plain matter of fact, what kind of Worſhip and addreſſes they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church make to Saints and Angels, rather than to enter into the large field of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, and formally to ſtate and diſpute theſe things; there being ſcarce any thing more requiſite to confute the uſages of that Church, than plainly to expoſe them to a full view: So in this particular eſpecially, concerning Worſhipping Angels, leſs one would imagine ſhould be needful to be ſaid about it, when the Scripture has ſo plainly and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determined this caſe, both by expreſs precept and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: So that I count it a vain and fooliſh thing to talk or argue with that man, who will maintain an opinion ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly croſs to as full an evidence as can well be deſired in the caſe: for it is certain he muſt act the part of a perverſe Sophiſter, whoſe wit only ſerves him to ſhift off and evade the force of that truth that ſtares him in the face, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver likely to examine any thing fairly and candidly. What can be a more plain caution againſt this Worſhip, than that of the Apoſtle? <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility, and worſhipping of Angels, intruding into thoſe things which he hath not ſeen, vainly puft up by his fleſhly mind. Not holding the head,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder to hear <hi>Baronius,</hi> who defends the Worſhipping of them,<note place="margin">Baron. ad an. <hi>60.</hi> Sec. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> to cry out, that <hi>this place is a very difficult one, not eaſie to be underſtood, and the difficulties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:52080:220"/>
be overcome without an exact skill in the affairs of thoſe times:</hi> and after a long inquiry into the opinions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus, Cerinthus</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophers;</hi> the great comfort is, that they have found out men that had ſuch opinions about Angels, which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church has not, and ſuch Worſhipping of them as is far more <hi>infamous</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> than any thing can be charged againſt them. Whereas the text is plain againſt all Worſhipping of Angels, and that others are <hi>more guilty,</hi> is no argument that they are <hi>innocent.</hi> No more than becauſe that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> or other Heathens thought that the very things they worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped were Gods, therefore the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not guilty of Idolatry in the matter of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> in offering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> or in ſacrificing to the <hi>Calves</hi> at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> in which it was impoſſible that they ſhould have ſuch low and vile thoughts of God, or ſuch high thoughts of thoſe Images themſelves, as the other had of theirs; but juſt ſuch as the <hi>Roman Church</hi> has, who think they acceptably worſhip God <hi>by them.</hi> The truth is, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeems to be many ways concerned in that place to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> about <hi>Worſhipping Angels,</hi> and to be condemned by ſeveral things there ſpoken, (though we ſhould grant, that the Apoſtle might have ſome <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in his eye, when he ſpoke them, who practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what he there condemns.) The learned <hi>Grotius</hi> (whom no body accounts too ſevere againſt their opinions) ſeems to give as plain an account of them as any, in his Comments upon the place. <hi>Intruding into thoſe things that he hath not ſeen</hi>] i. e. ſays he, <q>Penetrating into thoſe things which he hath not known; taking liberty to talk about unknown things: They ſet Angels over what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs they pleaſed, they put names upon them, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted them into Claſſes (and every one may know that the School-divinity about Angels, is very peremptory and preſuming in this kind; telling us in what place they were created, reſolving whether the number that ſtood was equal to that of thoſe that fell; the way whereby they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:52080:221"/>

Authors or deliverers of, but that which they practiſed. But I leave the Reader to conſult him in the forecited place, who has ſaid a great deal more, to ſhow the abſurdity of <hi>Cardinal Perron</hi>'s interpretation.</p>
               <p>But if there ſhould ſeem any difficulty in the Apoſtles words conſidered alone (though they are plain enough one would think till men begin to play tricks with them, and by that way any Law, though never ſo clear, may have ſome miſts caſt before the face of it, which may render it ſeemingly obſcure till they be diſperſed.) Yet now that the Scripture has given us precedents in the caſe, I mean examples of this adoration refuſed, even by thoſe Bleſſed Spirits to whom it is pretended to be due: what can any one deſire more for his ſatisfaction? The places are known to this purpoſe. <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10. <hi>And I fell at his feet to worſhip him; and he ſaid unto me, ſee thou do it not. I am thy fellow-ſervant and of thy Brethren that have the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Jeſus,</hi> worſhip God. And <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.8, 9. <hi>I fell down to worſhip before the feet of the Angel that ſhewed me theſe things; then ſaid he unto me; ſee thou do it not; for I am thy fellow-ſervant, and of thy Brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the ſayings of this book: worſhip God.</hi> Where you ſee the thing prohibited twice; and not only barely prohibited; but by the abrupt manner of the Angels ſpeaking, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the Greek, he ſhows his haſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to prevent it; and that too with a reaſon annexed; <hi>I am thy fellow-ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. which plainly concludes, that it was not the courteſie of the Angel, but the neceſſity of the thing, that made him ſo ſhye of accepting the profered ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and if this reaſon holds good as to Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then much more forceably doth it conclude againſt the religious worſhip of any Saint, who are all in a much ſtricter ſence our fellow-ſervants than Angels are: Nay farther, if not only for this reaſon it be undue to them, but alſo unjuſt and ſacrilegious as to God, the invading one of Gods properties, as the Angels laſt words imply, <hi>Worſhip thou God;</hi> (for if religious adoration were not ſuch a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:52080:223"/>
of his, and not to be communicated to any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, theſe words of the Angel might have received this ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie anſwer; worſhip God? Yes, ſo I intend always to do, yet give me leave too to worſhip thee.) I ſay, if all this do not give ſatisfaction in this Queſtion to an honeſt mind and plain-meaning perſon, it's hard to gueſs what will; and methinks it ſhould do ſo in reaſon to our adverſaries alſo, who profeſſing to venerate Angels, ought to revere their determinations and judgment of things; and not to be ſo uncivil as to argue <hi>Pro,</hi> when an Angel is on the other ſide, and determines <hi>Con.</hi> But neither man nor Angel can ſtop the mouth of a cavilling Sophiſter, but ſomething he will have to ſay, though little to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>It is ſo here in our caſe, we have <hi>another Cardinal</hi> (viz. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>) that is as buſie with his fine Quirks and Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, as the <hi>former</hi> was, to ſtop the mouth of theſe Texts from ſpeaking one ſyllable againſt worſhipping Angels; nay farther, (which is a bolder enterprize than that of <hi>Perron</hi>'s) he would make us believe that they ſpeak for it. For theſe are his words.<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Sanct. Beat. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi> ad Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum dico.</note> 
                  <q>To the fourth example (which is this of S. <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Angel</hi>) I ſay, it makes for us. For either <hi>John</hi> thought him, that appeared to him, to be God, or an Angel. If he thought him to be God, he was deſervedly reproved: (Sayſt thou ſo, great wit? If he in thy opinion deſerves to be reproved, who worſhips that which is not God, even when he <hi>thinks</hi> him <hi>to be God;</hi> pray what doſt thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, who art for worſhipping that which is not God (<hi>viz.</hi> a Saint or Angel) even when thou <hi>confeſſeſt</hi> that he is <hi>not God?</hi>) "If he thought him to be an Angel, and yet ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; why are we reproved, who do what <hi>John</hi> did? Do the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> know better than <hi>John,</hi> whether Angels are to be worſhipped?</q> There is none I dare ſay, whether <hi>Calviniſt</hi> or not, that is advanced any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably above a <hi>Natural,</hi> who can be in danger of being
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:52080:224"/>
hurt by this Horn of his <hi>Dilemma.</hi> For inſtead of asking, <hi>why are we reproved for doing what John did?</hi> One would think it's a more material queſtion to ask, Why was <hi>John himſelf</hi> reproved by the Angel for doing this, if it was, as you ſay, no fault, taking him to be an Angel, to worſhip him? Why do you worſhip Angels, knowing them to be ſuch, when <hi>John</hi> by an Angel was prohibited? What? do Cardinals know better than Angels, whether Angels are to be worſhipped?</p>
               <p>One of theſe Queſtions, the Cardinal thinks fit to take notice of. Why <hi>John</hi> was reprehended? His firſt anſwer was conſidered before, which is, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he eſteemed him to be Chriſt.<note place="margin">Bellarm. ibid.</note> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is more peremptory. <q>I ſay that <hi>John</hi> did well to give due worſhip to the Angel, as he remembred his Anceſtors <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> had done, (which is a great miſtake, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſufficiently proves againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> if he means it of any higher adoration, than was what cuſtomarily paid in thoſe Eaſtern Nations by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to great perſons,) "but the Angel prohibited it, in reverence to Chriſts humanity: for Angels before Chriſts coming ſuffered themſelves to be adored by men; but after that God was made man, and that all the Angels began to adore man in Chriſt, the Angels would not now be adored by men, and eſpecially by the Apoſtles and other great men.</q> [Well, however one would think we had gained thus much, by this diſcourſe of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> that now ſince the coming of Chriſt, all the old worſhip of Angels (if there was any) is at an end, and ought no more to be uſed; no ſuch matter, for he adds,] <q>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it does not follow that we do ill if we adore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; for we both rightly adore them, and they rightly refuſe to be adored.</q> A ſtrange Concluſion! If S. <hi>John</hi> at firſt did well in offering to adore them (before he knew that reaſon from our Saviours Incarnation, and the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Angels minds as to their willingneſs to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:52080:224"/>
thereupon.) Yet he could not be ſaid to do it (as he did) a ſecond time rightly (when it's to be hoped, he knew that reaſon as well as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> he cites) nor we, after that, to do it rightly, when the ſame reaſon ſtill holds, and we may preſume, that the Angels have not taken any toy, and changed their minds once more.</p>
               <p>But the ſecret of it (which is all I ſhall add) is plainly this: That the reprehenſion which the Angel gave to Saint <hi>John,</hi> according to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> was but a coppy of his countenance, and only a <hi>great complement:</hi> And all that the Angel ſaid to him in the forenamed Texts, comes but to thus much, if I may have leave to put it into other words, not injuring the <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſence.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>John,</hi> I ſee you underſtand the excellency of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and know how to addreſs your ſelf to perſons of our Birth and Quality; but at this time (under favour and with ſubmiſſion to your judgment) it is a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable to make theſe <hi>reverences:</hi> for we have all made an agreement, out of our particular reſpect to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> (whom we worſhip, and your nature in him) to wave all ceremonies of this kind from thoſe of the ſame nature with him, and eſpecially from you, that have had the honour to be of his Family and Attendance. Beſides, it is no time for us to inſiſt upon theſe Formalities, being now buſie with you to advance <hi>his name,</hi> while you carry the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the Gentiles: when his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is eſtabliſhed among them, then our <hi>Prince Michael</hi> will make ſome glorious appearances on Mount <hi>Garganus, Tumba,</hi> and ſome other places, and leave ſome <hi>precious remains</hi> to indear his and our memory to the world: then it will be a better ſeaſon to renew theſe complements; and of the punctual time, <hi>you,</hi> if you live ſo long, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>the Church</hi> ſhall infallibly have due notice, from a <hi>General Council,</hi> or, which comes all to one, from the <hi>Pope:</hi> when they will be alſo directed, to prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes

and ſcandals, to reſerve the worſhip of <hi>Latry</hi> for the Holy Trinity, and of <hi>Hyperduly</hi> for the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and for the Humanity of Chriſt, and to pay to us Angels the worſhip of <hi>Duly</hi> and no more: In the interim, for once be ruled by me and forbear; and deſire others to do ſo, and to pay their worſhip, where, in the preſent circumſtances, it is more ſeaſonable. Let it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, good <hi>John,</hi> that we accept the will for the deed, till that time come, when it will be your Duty to worſhip your <hi>Fellow-ſervants.</hi>
